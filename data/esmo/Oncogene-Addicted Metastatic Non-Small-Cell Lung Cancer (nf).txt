INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY

Details on incidence and epidemiology are covered in the Supplementary Material Section 1.

DIAGNOSIS, PATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

Diagnostic procedures

Details on diagnostic procedures are covered in the Supplementary Material Section 2. See Supplementary Figure S1 for a flow chart on diagnosis and testing biopsy/cytology samples in stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Pathology and molecular biology

Biomarker testing is essential to identify subgroups of NSCLC with oncogenic drivers that can be therapeutically targeted. These drivers are mainly found in lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs). Demonstration of the specific molecular alteration is necessary to tailor treatment with the appropriate targeted therapy. The frequency of oncogenic drivers in NSCLC as well as general discussion of testing strategy and methodology, including the use of liquid biopsies, can be found in the Supplementary Material Section 3.

Many parameters might determine which tests are required; pre-eminent amongst them is access to appropriate drugs.1 Testing is mandatory for oncogenic drivers for which drugs are approved for routine usage. Broader testing may be used to support early drug access or clinical trials.2, 3 For personalised therapy approaches, European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) classifications4 need to be considered (Supplementary Table S1).
Clinically-relevant EGFR gene mutations in NSCLC include substitutions, deletions and insertions in exons 18-21 that activate the tyrosine kinase and variably confer sensitivity or resistance to available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or other drugs.3, 5 The most common alterations conferring sensitivity to first- to third- generation TKIs are the exon 21 L858R substitution and exon 19 deletion mutations. At a minimum when resources or material are limited, these mutations should be
 
evaluated. The next most common alteration is a large group of exon 20 insertions mostly resistant to current EGFR-TKIs but sensitive to some emerging agents (discussed in the treatment paragraph including EGFR exon 20 insertions). Other mutations, including in exon 18, variably sensitise, while some mutations confer resistance and may drive disease relapse. Complete sequencing of exons 18-21 by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is strongly recommended, to identify all possible sensitising mutations. Some allele-specific EGFR sequencing solutions do not provide complete coverage. EGFR FISH or immunohistochemistry (IHC) have no clinical utility and should not be tested.

Fusions (rearrangements) involving ALK, ROS1, NTRK1-3 and RET genes are important oncogenic drivers in small groups of LUADs.3, 5 Each target has several TKIs available. Furthermore, NRG1 fusions are a potential emerging target in LUADs. Oncogenic fusion proteins result in constitutive activation of the kinase and may increase fusion gene protein levels, allowing for screening of tumours for some of these fusions by IHC. Positive ALK IHC with an appropriately validated assay may be used to prescribe ALK inhibitors. Cases positive by ROS1 or NTRK IHC must be confirmed by a molecular method; this may also be preferred for ALK IHC positive cases. Fusions can be detected by FISH, or multiplex RT-PCR panel assays, the latter requiring a tailored reaction for each potential fusion gene which makes this approach more complex. RNA-based NGS is preferred for identifying an expanding range of fusion genes. If NGS is used as the primary NTRK screening tool, IHC confirmation should be considered.6
Alterations in structure and/or expression of the MET gene drive oncogenesis in NSCLC.3, 5 High MET protein levels may be detected by IHC. Increased MET signalling may result from high gene copy number (GCN), either due to polysomy or true gene amplification. Detection is reliable by in situ hybridisation (ISH) techniques, but NGS or comparative genomic hybridisation may also identify cases. Definitions of high GCN vary and, in absence of current standardisation, confound existing data. MET exon 14 skipping mutations may be detected by DNA-based NGS, but RNA- based NGS may also identify additional cases missed by DNA sequencing.7 MET amplification is an important resistance mechanism driving acquired resistance to
 
EGFR (including osimertinib) and ALK inhibitors. MET kinase inhibitors are being investigated in several scenarios and approved in the MET exon 14 skipping setting.

KRAS mutations have become an important therapeutic target in LUADs and, unlike the other targets described here, are mostly smoking related.5 Specific inhibitors for KRAS G12C are now available. DNA sequencing and multiplex RT-PCR panel assays are the best approach to detection; most likely incorporated into NGS panels, as is the case for BRAF mutations. TKIs for BRAF V600E mutations are available.
HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are rare in LUADs, but promising targeted drugs and antibody drug conjugates are in development. Therefore, these mutations need to be covered with NGS panels.

Mutations coexisting with several of the above driver alterations may influence responses to targeted therapy and require additional treatment.8 Comutations in TP53 may be associated with lower efficacy of EGFR, ALK and ROS1 TKIs. Testing for comutations in an NGS panel may therefore become important.

Resistance to kinase inhibitors is almost inevitable and is variably due to the emergence of therapy-resistant tumour cell clones with target gene alteration, increased bypass pathway signalling and/or phenotypic transformation (small-cell, squamous cell carcinoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma).9 As treatments to target resistance mechanisms emerge, so does testing to detect each mechanism, and a need either for rebiopsy or, if appropriate, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing. Widespread use of osimertinib in the first line for EGFR-mutant NSCLC has decreased the importance of EGFR T790M detection but increases the need for identifying MET amplification as treatments for the latter are being evaluated.

Recommendations

•	Adequate tissue material for histological diagnosis and molecular testing should be obtained to allow for individual treatment decisions [IV, A]. For recommended methods to obtain tissue, please refer to the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on non-oncogene addicted mNSCLC.10
 
•	Pathological diagnosis should be made according to the 2015 World Health Organization classification of lung tumours [IV, A].
•	Specific subtyping of all NSCLCs is necessary for therapeutic decision making and should be carried out wherever possible. IHC stains should be used to reduce the NSCLC-not otherwise specified rate to fewer than 10% of cases diagnosed [IV, A].
•	The molecular tests below are recommended in patients with advanced non- squamous cell carcinoma, and not recommended in patients with a confident diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, except in unusual cases, e.g. young (<50 years) patients, never/former light smokers (≤15 packyears) or long-time ex- smokers (quit smoking >15 years ago) [IV, A].
•	EGFR mutation status should be determined [I, A]. Test methodology should have adequate coverage of mutations in exons 18-21, including those associated with resistance to some therapies [III, A]. At a minimum, when resources or material are limited, the most common activating mutations (exon 19 deletion, exon 21 L858R point mutation) should be determined [I, A].
•	The availability of TKIs effective against T790M-mutant recurrent disease makes T790M testing on disease relapse on first or second generation EGFR-TKI mandatory [I, A].
•	Testing for ALK rearrangements should be carried out [I, A].
•	Detection of the ALK translocation by FISH remains a standard, but IHC with high-performance ALK antibodies and validated assays may be used for
screening [III, A] and have been accepted as an equivalent alternative to FISH for ALK testing.
•	Testing for ROS1-rearrangements should be carried out [II, A]. Detection of the ROS1 translocation by FISH remains a standard; IHC may be used as a screening approach [IV, A].
•	BRAF V600 mutation status testing should be carried out [II, A].
•	Testing for NTRK rearrangements should be carried out [II, A]. Screening for NTRK rearrangements may use IHC or NGS, with appropriate testing follow-up to validate a positive result [II, A].
 
•	Testing for MET exon 14 skipping mutations, MET amplifications, RET- rearrangements, KRAS G12C mutations and HER2 mutations should be carried out [II, A].
•	If available, multiplex platforms (NGS) for molecular testing are preferable [III, A].
•	RNA-based NGS is preferred for identifying an expanding range of fusion genes [III, B]. Whichever testing modality is used, it is mandatory that adequate internal validation and quality control measures are in place and that laboratories participate in, and perform adequately in, external quality assurance schemes for each biomarker test [III, A].
•	cfDNA (liquid biopsy) can be used to test for oncogenic drivers as well as resistance mutations, but all patients with a negative cfDNA blood test still require tissue biopsy [II, A].


STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT

Details on staging and risk assessment are covered in the Supplementary Material Section 4.

Recommendations

•	A complete history including a precise smoking history and comorbidities, weight loss, performance status (PS) and physical examination must be recorded [IV, A].
•	Laboratory standard tests including routine haematology, renal and hepatic functions and bone biochemistry tests are required. Other tests [e.g. lipid spectrum and creatine kinase (CK) levels] depend on toxicity of the targeted therapy that will be used [IV, A].
•	An electrocardiogram is required if the targeted therapy can cause adverse cardiac events, including rhythmic modifications (e.g. long QT) [IV, A].
•	Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and upper abdomen (including the liver and adrenal glands) should be carried out at diagnosis [IV, A].
 
•	Imaging of the central nervous system (CNS) should be considered at diagnosis for all patients with metastatic disease [IV, B] and is required for patients with neurological symptoms or signs [IV, A]. If available, CNS imaging with gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered for all patients [IV, B].
•	If bone metastases are clinically suspected, bone imaging is required [IV, B].
•	Bone scintigraphy, ideally coupled with CT, can be used for detection of bone metastasis [IV, B]. PET-CT is the most sensitive modality in detecting bone metastasis [III, B].
•	FDG-PET-CT and brain imaging are recommended in patients suspected for oligometastatic disease [IV, A]. In the presence of a solitary metastatic site on imaging studies, efforts should be made to obtain a cytological or histological confirmation of stage IV disease [IV, A].
•	For oligometastatic disease, mediastinal disease should be pathology proven if this potentially impacts the treatment plan [IV, A].
•	NSCLC must be staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM (tumour–node– metastasis) 8th edition staging manual and must be grouped into the stage categories shown in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 [IV, A].
•	Response evaluation is recommended after 8-12 weeks of treatment, using the same radiographic investigation that initially demonstrated the tumour lesions [IV, B]. Follow-up with a PET scan is not routinely recommended, due to its relatively low specificity despite a high sensitivity [IV, C].
•	Measurements and response assessment should follow Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 [IV, A].11 The clinical relevance of RECIST in evaluating the response remains debatable as patients can derive benefit from continuing the same TKI after RECIST v1.1 progression [III, A].

MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED AND METASTATIC DISEASE

See Figure 1 for a treatment algorithm after positive findings on molecular tests.

EGFR-mutated NSCLC
 
See Figure 2 for a treatment algorithm for patients with EGFR-activating mutations.

First-line EGFR-TKI for EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R.EGFR-TKIs have become the standard first-line therapy for patients with a classical activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) since the confirmation of the superiority of first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib), over platinum- based doublet chemotherapy (ChT) in terms of tumour response rate, safety, quality of life and progression-free survival (PFS).12, 13 Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (e.g. afatinib and dacomitinib) have a higher potency of EGFR inhibition via irreversible covalent binding and are pan-HER inhibitors. Afatinib compared with gefitinib improved PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.95] but not overall survival (OS; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66-1.12) in the LUX-Lung 7 phase IIB randomised controlled trial (RCT) (N = 319).14 In contrast, dacomitinib was superior to gefitinib in the ARCHER 1050 phase III RCT (N = 452) regarding PFS (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74) as well as OS, although the latter could not formally be tested due to hierarchical testing rules.15, 16 Compared with first-generation EGFR-TKIs, second- generation TKIs are associated with more toxicities (acneiform rash, stomatitis, diarrhoea), leading to dose reduction. The third-generation EGFR-TKIs also inhibit the resistant EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation. Osimertinib has the largest international approval while others are approved only in South Korea and China (e.g. lazertinib and almonertinib, respectively). Osimertinib was compared with first- generation EGFR-TKIs in the FLAURA phase III RCT (N = 556), demonstrating a superior median PFS (mPFS) and median OS (mOS), with 18.9 versus 10.2 months (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.57) and 38.6 versus 31.8 months (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-
1.00), respectively.17, 18 Blood–brain–barrier penetration is higher for osimertinib compared with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs, resulting in CNS response rates over 60%.19 Of note, patients with stable CNS metastases were allowed in the LUX-Lung 7 and FLAURA trials, while all CNS metastases were excluded from the ARCHER 1050 trial.14, 15, 17
Serious adverse event (AE) rates are also lower for osimertinib.15, 17, 20 These positive outcomes have established osimertinib as a preferable first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, especially for patients with
 
CNS metastases. If osimertinib is not available in the first line, it is still acceptable to sequentially use first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and dacomitinib) followed by osimertinib, specifically for T790M-positive resistant disease (occurring in approximately half of the patients). Other first-line strategy options are combinations of EGFR-TKIs and ChT [not European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved] or combination of EGFR-TKIs and anti-angiogenics, which have shown significant improvement in PFS in phase III RCTs (e.g. erlotinib– bevacizumab and erlotinib–ramucirumab).21-25 However, for anti-angiogenics either no OS benefit was observed or OS data is not yet mature.21-23 For ChT-gefitinib combinations, only superiority over first-generation EGFR-TKIs has been demonstrated for OS,24, 25 while the benefit compared with osimertinib is not clear.
Furthermore, with longer follow-up the OS benefit for ChT-gefitinib was not statistically significant anymore in the NEJ009 trial.26 Moreover, toxicity, inconvenience for patients and costs increase with adding another treatment. Therefore, single-agent (third generation) EGFR-TKIs are still one standard first-line treatment.

First-line EGFR TKI for uncommon EGFR mutations. Although the majority of activating EGFR mutations are exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R point mutation, 10% to 20% of patients present with an uncommon, non-exon 20 insertion mutation. In retrospective studies, first-generation EGFR-TKIs result in a lower overall response rate (ORR) and PFS compared with exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R.27 In an analysis of several databases comprising also a pooled analysis of several Lux-Lung trials including major uncommon mutations, afatinib resulted in an ORR of 60% and a median time to treatment failure of 10.8 months.28 Osimertinib resulted in an ORR of 53% and a mPFS of 8.2 months in a single arm phase II study.29 Therefore, afatinib and osimertinib can be considered for uncommon EGFR mutations.

Management of EGFR-TKI resistance. Oligoprogression is discussed under ‘Special Populations: oligometastases’.

The EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation is the most common cause of resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs, accounting for 50% to 60% of cases. In the
 
T790M setting, osimertinib was superior to platinum-doublet ChT in the AURA 3 phase III RCT (N = 419), with a mPFS of 10.1 versus 4.4 months (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23-0.41), respectively.30 Therefore, the T790M status should be evaluated in all patients progressing on first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs, either on tissue or in plasma, as also those with T790M in plasma benefit.31 Osimertinib should be given to those with a T790M positive tumour, if not given in first line. As patients with a tumour negative for T790M obtain less benefit from osimertinib, platinum-based doublet ChT should be offered to these patients.32
With the increasing use of osimertinib either in first- or second-line therapy, management of resistance to osimertinib has become a major clinical issue. Resistance mechanisms are more diverse compared with first- and second- generation EGFR-TKIs, and frequency of a certain genomic finding also depends on whether osimertinib is given in first or second line.33 The most common genomic findings include EGFR exon 20 C797X mutation, MET amplification, ERBB2 amplification and other non-EGFR pathway aberrations.33 A number of novel approaches are being developed to manage osimertinib resistance. Preferably, patients progressing on osimertinib are enrolled in a clinical trial, if possible (extensively discussed in an ESMO expert consensus paper),34 standard treatment is platinum-doublet ChT. Patients who have moderate asymptomatic radiological progression with ongoing clinical benefit may continue with EGFR-TKIs.35, 36 However, it is advisable to test for resistance mechanisms when feasible as tumour growth can become rapid with insufficient time to determine the resistance mechanism upon symptomatic progression.

The role of immunotherapy. Despite the tremendous success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in lung cancer, the role of ICIs in the management of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC remains controversial. These agents have a role in advanced-line settings after exhaustion of TKI treatment, preferably in combination with ChT and angiogenesis inhibition. The IMMUNOTARGET registry is a retrospective analysis on efficacy of single agent ICIs in patients with driver oncogenes.37 Tumour response in patients with EGFR mutations was 12% and mPFS and mOS were 2.1 and 10.0 months, respectively. In a subgroup analysis (n =
 
91 patients with a sensitising EGFR mutation of which 78 EGFR TKI pre-treated) of the IMpower150 phase III RCT, the combination of paclitaxel–carboplatin– bevacizumab–atezolizumab compared with paclitaxel–carboplatin–bevacizumab, showed longer mOS for the quadruplet: 29.4 versus 18.1 months (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31-1.14). Similar results were found for the group pretreated with EGFR-TKIs.38 Despite the limited sample size, this regimen has been widely adopted as a treatment option for patients with EGFR mutations after progression on EGFR-TKIs. The phase III ORIENT-31 trial (sintilimab plus the bevacizumab biosimilar IBI305 plus pemetrexed-cisplatin versus sintilimab plus pemetrexed-cisplatin versus pemetrexed-cisplatin) in which Chinese patients with a sensitizing EGFR mutation and progression on EGFR TKI were enrolled (N=444) supports the quadruplet regimen, as mPFS was significantly longer in the quadruplet versus ChT only arm:
6.9 versus 4.3 months (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.34-0.64, P<0.001). OS data is not mature yet.39


ALK-rearranged NSCLC

See Figure 3 for a treatment algorithm for patients with ALK translocations.

First-line treatment. Crizotinib, the first in class ALK-TKI,40 improved outcomes (PFS, ORR and quality of life) compared with platinum-based ChT for the initial treatment of patients with newly diagnosed ALK-rearranged NSCLC in the phase III PROFILE 1014 trial,41 establishing first-line ALK-TKIs as standard of care (SoC).
Ceritinib, a second-generation ALK-TKI, was also superior to ChT in the first-line setting.42 Newer generation ALK-TKIs, however, have been shown in phase III RCTs to be superior to crizotinib in the first-line setting, including alectinib,43 brigatinib,44 ensartinib (not EMA approved)45 and lorlatinib.46 Alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib are preferred for initial treatment.

Alectinib. In the ALEX phase III RCT (N = 303), alectinib compared with crizotinib43 resulted in a superior investigator-assessed mPFS (34.8 versus 10.9 months, HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32-0.58).47 Grade 3-5 toxicities were similar in frequency for alectinib versus crizotinib (52% versus 56%). AEs that occurred more frequently
 
with alectinib included anaemia, myalgia, elevated bilirubin, weight gain and skin photosensitivity. CNS ORR and time to CNS progression were superior for alectinib.48 Median OS was not reached with alectinib versus 57.4 months with crizotinib (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.98), and the 5-year OS rates were 63% and 46%, respectively,47 establishing a benchmark for OS in this population. Two other first- line phase III trials [J-ALEX (Japan).49 and ALESIA (Asia)50] reported similar outcomes.

Brigatinib. In the ALTA-1L phase III RCT (N = 275), brigatinib was compared with crizotinib. The 3-year PFS by blinded, independent central review was superior for brigatinib compared with crizotinib (43% versus 19%). Median PFS was longer (24.0 versus 11.1 months; HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35-0.66).44 mOS was not reached in either group.

Benefit was seen across subgroups particularly in patients with brain metastases. AEs that occurred at a higher incidence with brigatinib included increased CK levels, cough, and hypertension. Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 4% of patients.

Ensartinib (not EMA approved). The eXalt3 phase III RCT (N = 290) comparing ensartinib with crizotinib demonstrated improved mPFS with ensartinib (25.8 versus 12.7 months; HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35-0.72).45 Rash, elevated transaminases and pruritis were the most common AEs.

Lorlatinib. In the CROWN phase III RCT (N = 296) lorlatinib resulted in a significantly longer independently-determined mPFS than crizotinib [not reached (NR) versus 9.3 months; HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.41].46 Intracranial ORR and time to intracranial progression were superior for lorlatinib. The most common AEs of any grade with lorlatinib were hyperlipidaemia, oedema, increased weight, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive effects. Lorlatinib was associated with more grade 3-4 AEs (mainly altered lipid levels) than crizotinib (72% versus 56%).
Of note, there have not been direct comparisons between the newer generation ALK-TKIs. The choice of drug will be influenced by factors including the extent of
 
CNS disease, patient preference and the need to manage the distinct toxicity profiles seen with these drugs.

Beyond first-line treatment. Oligoprogression is discussed under ‘Special Populations: oligometastases’.

Progression on crizotinib.For patients who have had initial therapy with crizotinib, treatment with newer generation inhibitors has shown efficacy intracranially and extracranially.

In the ASCEND-5 phase III RCT (N = 231), ceritinib was superior to single-agent ChT (PFS HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36-0.67) in patients with progression on crizotinib and platinum-doublet ChT.51
In the phase III RCT ALUR (n = 107), alectinib was superior to single-agent ChT (docetaxel or pemetrexed) in patients previously treated with platinum-based doublet ChT and crizotinib (PFS HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17-0.59).52 Grade ≥3 AEs were less frequent (27% versus 41%) and CNS efficacy was also improved with alectinib.

Activity of brigatinib in patients previously treated with crizotinib was confirmed in a phase II study where a 90 mg dose lead-in for 7 days followed by 180 mg was compared with 90 mg daily.53 Improved results were seen with the 180 mg dosing compared with the 90 mg dosing, with mPFS of 16.7 months and intracranial ORR of 67%.

Although lorlatinib is active in patients progressing on crizotinib, with an ORR of 69%, intracranial ORR of 68% and mPFS not reached,54 the EMA approval for lorlatinib post-crizotinib also requires prior second-generation TKI treatment.55

Progression on a second-generation ALK TKI. Lorlatinib has shown activity in a phase I/II study54 in patients treated with prior second-generation TKIs. In patients treated with two or three prior ALK-TKIs (with or without previous ChT), ORR was 39%, mPFS was 6.9 months and intracranial ORR was 53%. Although response rates were higher in patients who had identified ALK mutations, lorlatinib remained active even in patients who did not have identified mutations. Brigatinib has also
 
been reported to have activity in patients progressing on alectinib in two single-arm studies with response rates of 34% to 40%.56, 57 Rebiopsy of progressing tumour tissue or plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis may identify resistance mutations or alternative mechanisms of resistance assisting selection of subsequent therapies.

Following progression on lorlatinib, ChT with a platinum-pemetrexed-based combination is recommended. The additional value of ICIs is uncertain as ALK- positive NSCLC has been excluded from most ICI trials with the exception of IMpower150 where benefit was observed in a small subgroup including ALK-positive NSCLC.58
Treatment of ROS1-rearranged NSCLC

See Figure 4 for a treatment algorithm for patients with ROS1 translocations.

Crizotinib was the first approved TKI for the treatment of ROS1-rearranged advanced NSCLC, based on the results of the ROS1 expansion cohort of the phase I trial PROFILE 1001 study (N = 53), which included treatment-naïve patients and those who had received prior ChT. ORR was 72% and mPFS and mOS were 19.3 and 51.4 months, respectively. Four-year survival rate was 51%.59 Based on these results, single-agent crizotinib is recommended in the first-line setting in this patient population. If patients have received crizotinib in the first-line setting, then they may be offered platinum-based ChT in the second-line setting.

Entrectinib is a next-generation ROS1 and NTRK TKI. In an updated analysis of three ongoing phase I or II trials (ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1 and STARTRK-2), including 161 patients with ROS1-rearranged advanced NSCLC (60 treatment naïve, two previously treated with crizotinib), ORR was 67%, mPFS was 15.7 months and mOS was not reached. For the patients with baseline CNS metastases (n = 24), intracranial ORR was 79%, median intracranial PFS was 12 months and mOS was
28.3 months.60 Entrectinib received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (2019)61 and EMA conditional marketing authorisation (2020)62 for the treatment
of ROS1-rearranged NSCLC not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors. Entrectinib,
 
if available, based on these results, is preferred over crizotinib in patients with brain metastases.

Ceritinib was tested in a single-arm phase II study (N = 32), ORR was 62%, mPFS was 19.3 months for crizotinib-naïve patients (the two crizotinib-pretreated patients died or withdrew before first response evaluation) and mOS was 24 months.63
Lorlatinib also targets ROS1 with preclinical activity against most known resistance mutations in the gene, and was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, phase I-II trial (N = 69, 40 patients had received crizotinib as their only previous TKI, eight had previously received a non-crizotinib ROS1 TKI or two or more ROS1 TKIs). ORR was 62% in TKI-naïve patients and 35% in crizotinib-pretreated patients. Intracranial ORR was 64% (7/11) and 50% (12/24) in TKI-naïve and crizotinib pretreated patients, respectively. The median duration of response (mDoR) was 25.3 and 13.8 months for the TKI-naïve and crizotinib pre-treated patients, respectively.64 Both ceritinib and lorlatinib are not approved by EMA.

Repotrectinib, a novel next-generation ROS1/TRK/ALK-TKI showed promising activity in the early phase TRIDENT-1 trial.65 Repotrectinib received FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of ROS1 positive treatment-naïve as well as TKI pretreated NSCLC.



BRAF mutations

See Figure 5 for a treatment algorithm for patients with BRAF V600 mutations.

Activating BRAF mutations are alternative oncogenic drivers in NSCLC that are generally mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements. In a vemurafenib basket trial (N = 62 BRAF V600 mutant NSCLC), ORR was 38% in previously untreated patients (n = 8) and 37% in previously treated patients (n = 54).66, 67 In the AcSé vemurafenib trial, no responses were observed in patients with NSCLC and a non-BRAF V600 mutation (n = 17). ORR was 45%, mDoR 6.4 months, mPFS 5.2 months and mOS 10.0 months in the BRAF V600 cohort (n = 101).68
 
A prospective, multicentre, multicohort phase II study (BRF113928) of dabrafenib monotherapy (cohort A, n = 78), or combination therapy with a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) beyond first line (cohort B, n = 57) or in first line (cohort C, n = 36) in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mNSCLC was reported. With dabrafenib monotherapy, the ORR was 33% and mPFS and mDoR were 5.5 and 9.6 months, respectively.69 With the combination of dabrafenib–trametinib in pretreated patients, the ORR was 68% (54.8-80.1) and mPFS and mDoR were 10.2 months (95% CI 6.9-
16.7 months) and 9.8 months (95% CI 6.9-18.3 months), respectively.70 With combination dabrafenib–trametinib therapy in treatment-naive patients, the ORR was 64% (46% to 79%) and mPFS and mDoR were 10.8 months (95% CI 7.0-14.5 months) and 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3-15.2 months), respectively.70 In pretreated and treatment-naïve patients, respectively, the mOS was 18.2 months (95% CI 14.3-
28.6 months; 4- and 5-year survival rates: 34% and 22%, respectively) and 17.3 months (95% CI 12.3-40.2 months; 4- and 5-year survival rates: 26% and 19%, respectively).70 These results represent a clinically-significant improvement over both single-agent dabrafenib and conventional ChT. Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib is recommended for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600-mutant advanced or metastatic NSCLC (trial only enrolled V600E-positive patients). Very few data on the benefit of single-agent ICI in the BRAF-mutant population are available. Results of the international IMMUNOTARGET study (43 patients with BRAF-mutant, 40% V600E) showed poor outcomes in BRAF-mutant patients, with an ORR of 24% and a mPFS of 3.1 months.37 Consistent with this, another retrospective study investigating the efficacy of single-agent ICI in NSCLC with oncogene addiction, confirmed that patients with BRAF V600-mutant (n = 28 patients) showed a response rate of 26%.71
RET fusions

Selpercatinib, a RET-selective inhibitor, was evaluated in the phase I/II LIBRETTO- 001 study in patients with RET-rearranged NSCLC.72 The ORR was 64% (95% CI 54% to 73%) in 105 platinum-pretreated patients and 85% (95% CI 70% to 94%) in 39 treatment-naïve patients. The mDoR was 17.5 months in pretreated and NR for treatment-naïve patients. Pralsetinib, another RET-selective inhibitor, was evaluated in the ARROW study;73 the ORR was 59% (95% CI 50% to 67%) in 136 platinum
 
pretreated patients and 72% (95% CI 60% to 82%) in 75 treatment-naïve patients. The mDoR was NR in treatment-naive patients and 22.3 months for pretreated patients. Importantly, both agents are associated with high intracranial response rates.73, 74 Treatment with selpercatinib or pralsetinib (for both: EMA indication is for those not previously treated with a RET inhibitor)75, 76 is recommended in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC.

Several additional oncogenic drivers which can be targeted by specific targeted therapies
For the oncogenic drivers discussed below, there are currently no EMA first-line targeted agents approved. For METexon 14 skipping mutations, capmatinib and tepotinib are approved by FDA but not EMA in first line. If no first line targeted options are available, treatments for non-oncogene addicted tumors are often extrapolated to those with an oncogenic driver. ICIs with or without ChT are the SoC first-line treatment for patients with non-oncogene addicted NSCLC.10 However, except for KRAS, data regarding efficacy of ICI monotherapy are very limited for these drivers (and if available, efficacy is limited).37 Even fewer data are available for ChT–ICI. A non-smoking history is associated with lower ICI efficacy.77 Therefore, for the drivers discussed in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated, platinum-doublet ChT with or without ICI is recommended as first-line therapy, and ICI monotherapy is not recommended.

MET exon 14 skipping mutations and MET amplifications. Two type Ib MET inhibitors have gained regulatory approval for patients with cMET exon 14 skipping mutations; capmatinib and tepotinib.78, 79 Among the MET exon 14-positive patients treated with capmatinib in the GEOMETRY study, the ORR was 41% (95% CI 29% to 53%) in 69 pretreated patients and 68% (95% CI 48% to 84%) in 28 treatment-
naïve patients; the mDoR was 9.7 months (95% CI 5.6-13.0 months) and 12.6 months (95% CI 5.5 months to NR), respectively.80 Among patients with high MET amplification (≥10 copies), ORR was 29% (95% CI 19% to 41%) in previously-treated
patients and 40% (95% CI 16% to 68%) in treatment-naive patients.80 Among the 152 patients with a MET exon 14 skipping mutation that received tepotinib in the VISION study, where enrolment was either based on tissue or liquid biopsy results,
 
the ORR was 45% (95% CI 37% to 53%), with an mDoR of 11.1 months (95% CI
8.4-18.5 months) and mPFS of 8.9 months (95% CI 8.2-11.2 months) in the combined-biopsy group.81 According to the EMA labels, both agents can be recommended following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based ChT in patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations.78, 79 Both agents have a first line label according to the FDA. Capmatinib can be given patients with high MET amplification (≥10 GCN) following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based ChT, but is not EMA nor FDA approved.

HER2 exon 20 mutations. Several pan-HER TKIs including afatinib, dacomitinib and neratinib, have been studied in small phase II studies with disappointing results, although some genotypes retain sensitivity.82 Poziotinib resulted in an ORR of 28% (95% CI 19% to 38%), a mPFS of 5.5 months (95% CI 3.9-5.8 months) and mDoR of
5.1 months (95% CI 4.2-5.5 months) in a phase II trial enrolling pretreated patients with HER2-mutated NSCLC (n = 90).83 The antibody–drug conjugates directed against HER2 have generated more positive results. Trastuzumab–emtansine was evaluated in a basket study including 18 pretreated patients with HER2-mutated LUAD.84 The ORR was 44% (95% CI 22% to 69%). Trastuzumab–deruxtecan was evaluated in the DESTINY LUNG01 study enrolling 91 HER2-mutated pretreated NSCLC patients.85 The ORR was 55% (95% CI 44% to 65%) and mDoR was 9.3 months (95% CI 5.7-14.7 months). Of concern is drug-related ILD that occurred in 26% of patients and resulted in the death of two patients. Trastuzumab–deruxtecan (FDA approved), if available, can be recommended for patients following prior first- line therapy but is not EMA approved.

NTRK fusions. Based on basket trials including a small number of NTRK fusion- positive NSCLC patients, larotrectinib and entrectinib have gained regulatory approval in the European Union. Due to the rarity of this alteration (<0.1%), both agents have been evaluated in basket trials containing small numbers of NSCLC patients, all pretreated. The ORR for entrectinib among 22 NSCLC patients (total 121 patients) enrolled in three ongoing phase I-II studies was 64% with a mPFS of
14.9 months and mDoR of 19.9 months.86 Pooled results from two trials evaluating larotrectinib reported an ORR of 73% (95% CI 45% to 92%) for patients with NSCLC
 
(n = 20, 15 evaluable). Median DoR, PFS and OS were 33.9 months (95% CI 5.6-
33.9 months), 35.4 months (95% CI 5.3-35.4 months) and 40.7 months (95% CI 17.2 months to NR), respectively.87 Both agents are recommended to treat NTRK fusion- positive NSCLC that received prior SoC treatment.

KRAS G12C mutations. KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in NSCLC, and KRAS G12C is the most frequent mutation. For KRAS G12C it is recommended to follow the first line treatment algorithms in the ESMO CPG on non-oncogene addicted NSCLC (in writing).10 Platinum-doublet ChT can be given as a second line option to patients treated in the first line with monotherapy ICI. The KRAS G12C specific inhibitor sotorasib has completed phase III testing in platinum- and ICI- pretreated patients.88 In the CodeBreak200 trial (N=345), sotorasib was superior to docetaxel: mPFS was 5.6 versus 4.5 months (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51-0.86, p= 0.002). No difference in mOS was shown, but the study was not powered for OS. Grade
≥TRAE occurred less frequently in the sotorasib arm (33.1% versus 40.4%).. Sotorasib is therefore recommended for treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC failing prior therapy. Adagrasib, which received FDA breakthrough designation, is another KRAS G12C inhibitor. In a registrational phase II cohort, ORR was 43% (95% CI 33.5% to 52.6%) in 112 evaluable patients. Median DoR was 8.5 months
(95% CI 6.2-13.8 months), and mPFS was 6.5 months (95% CI 4.7-8.4 months).89

EGFR exon 20 insertions. EGFR exon 20 insertions (EGFRex20ins) confer limited sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs and ICIs. Therefore, the preferred first-line treatment is platinum-doublet ChT. Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET is approved by both the EMA and FDA for patients with tumours progressing on platinum-doublet ChT.90, 91 In a phase I study (n = 81), ORR was 40% with an mDoR of 11.1 months and a mPFS of 8.3 months.92 Amivantamab can be recommended for treatment of EGFRex20ins-mutated NSCLC failing prior therapy. Mobocertinib, an EGFR-TKI, showed activity in a phase I/II trial in patients with previously treated NSCLC (n = 114 platinum-pretreated), with an IRC-assessed ORR of 28%, an mDoR of 17.5 months and a mPFS of 7.3 months.93 Mobocertinib is FDA but not EMA approved.94
Special populations
 
PS2 and beyond. Some of the randomised phase III TKI trials allowed entry to patients with PS2 (4% to 14% of patients). If subgroups analyses were presented for patients with PS2, a benefit of the TKI was generally seen in this patient population.95 Although the data is limited for patients with PS>2, TKIs should be given to patients with a poor PS due to the cancer, as ORR is high and toxicity is manageable. Most trial data regarding poor PS is derived from EGFR- and ALK-TKI trials. In all trials, toxicity was mild, ORR high and most patients improved in PS.96-98 It is reasonable to assume that efficacy data can be extrapolated to other oncogenic drivers.

Elderly. In all randomised phase III EGFR- and ALK-TKI trials, elderly patients (defined as ≥65 years) were enrolled and comprised 10% to 50% of the total patient population. Elderly patients derive the same, or even more benefit compared with younger patients, as PFS HR was generally lower in the elderly patient population.95 In a pooled analysis of phase II and III gefitinib trials, a PFS benefit for gefitinib versus ChT was found for patients aged ≥70 years (N = 71).99 Only limited trial data exists for patients aged ≥75 years, but these patients seem to derive the same benefit.100, 101

Oligometastases. Reliable data on the incidence of synchronous oligometastatic disease in patients with metastatic oncogene-addicted NSCLC do not exist. In a retrospective series (N = 266), 38% of patients with metastatic LUAD and an EGFR mutation, treated with first-generation TKIs, developed oligoprogression during TKI treatment.102
Data regarding the role of local ablative therapy (LAT) for oligometastatic oncogene- addicted NSCLC is scarce, mainly available for EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and mostly derived from retrospective series, subgroup analysis of phase II RCTs and one phase III RCT. A retrospective series evaluating patients with oligometastatic or oligoprogressive LUAD and an oncogenic driver (mainly EGFR) suggests that the addition of LAT improves OS and PFS compared with TKI treatment alone.103
Two small single-arm phase II trials also suggest that LAT improves survival.104, 105 In the phase II trial of Gomez et al., enrolling patients with synchronous oligometastatic
 
NSCLC without progression on systemic therapy, patients with an EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement were allowed (n = 8 out of 49 enrolled patients). The presence of an oncogenic driver was associated with a reduced risk of death but due to small numbers, no subgroup analyses according to the addition of LAT could be carried out.106
One open-label phase III RCT (SINDAS) reported interim results for patients with oligometastatic LUAD (N = 133, five or fewer metastases) and an EGFR mutation, patients with brain metastases were excluded.107 The addition of radiotherapy (RT) (25-40 Gy in 5 fractions to all involved disease sites) to first-generation EGFR-TKIs significantly improved mPFS and mOS, [20.2 versus 12.5 months, (HR 0.68, P < 0.001) and 25.5 versus 17.4 months, (HR 0.68, P < 0.001), respectively]. Despite the PFS and OS advantages, a high screen-failure rate (78%) combined with a non- typical group of patients with EGFR mutations (brain metastases excluded and ~70% of all metastases being bone metastases) does not allow extrapolation of the results to routine clinical practice.

There are fewer prospective data available for patients with oligoprogressive disease on TKI treatment. For recommendations regarding oligoprogression in the brain, please refer to the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO)–ESMO CPG on Brain metastases from solid tumours for recommendations.108 Based on a prematurely-closed, single-arm phase II trial it is suggested that patients with oligoprogression on erlotinib can benefit from LAT as mPFS after LAT was 6 months.109 Retrospective data also suggest a survival benefit of LAT for oligoprogressive lesions with the continuation of the TKI.103 Prospective trials are ongoing.

Currently, there is a lack of prospective data evaluating the use of a specific LAT (RT versus surgery). The role of minimally-invasive thoracic surgery, in particular with the use of modern technologies (robotic systems), is also becoming the new standard in pretreated complex surgical cases due to benefits compared with traditional open approaches.
 
Patients with synchronous or oligoprogressive, oncogene-driven NSCLC should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumour board and, if possible, enrolled in a clinical trial.

•	TKIs should be given to elderly patients [II, A].
•	Patients with oligometastatic disease at diagnosis may experience long-term PFS following systemic therapy and LAT (high-dose RT or surgery) [II, B]. Due to limited available evidence, these patients should be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumour board [II, B], and inclusion in clinical trials is preferred. Patients with advanced NSCLC and a driver mutation, with oligoprogression while on molecular-targeted therapy, may be treated with a LAT (high-dose RT or surgery) and may experience long-term DFS [IV, C]. However, this is based mainly on retrospective data and inclusion in clinical trials is preferred.
FOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND SURVIVORSHIP

Details on follow-up, long-term implications and survivorship, as well as palliative care in stage IV NSCLC are covered in the Supplementary Material Section 5
 
Recommendations

Follow-up, long-term implications and survivorship

•	Follow-up every 8-12 weeks should be carried out if there is an option for a next line of therapy [IV, A].

•	Smoking cessation should be encouraged [IV, A].

Palliative care in stage IV

Early palliative care intervention is recommended, in parallel with standard oncological care [I, A].
