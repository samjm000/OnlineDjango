Central venous access in oncology: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines†

introduction
This guideline applies to central venous access in adult cancer patients, which includes peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), tunnelled central catheters and totally implantable devices. Since most evidence comes from the use of central venous catheters (CVCs) in patients with a diversity of pathologies, some recommendations are based on guidelines and studies which may lack some speciﬁcity for cancer patients.

central venous access: insertion
Long-term central venous access devices are essential in the management of oncology patients, as they minimise the discom- fort of frequent venipuncture and cannulation.
There are four main classiﬁcations of CVCs [1, 2]:
•	Non-tunnelled catheters, which are indicated for short-term use when peripheral venous access is unachievable.
•	Tunnelled central catheters, used when long-term access (>30
days) is required for the administration of chemotherapy, antibiotics, parenteral feeding and blood products.
•	Fully implantable or surgically implantable catheters (ports or
port-a-caths), also provided for long-term use and associated with a low risk of infection. The device, which consists of a chamber (completely metallic, plastic or both) connected to a catheter, is placed under the skin. The catheter is threaded into the sub-clavian, jugular or femoral vein. The subcutaneous res- ervoir is placed in a pocket created in front of the pectoralis major muscle, in the sub-clavicular region. The reservoir is accessed via a speciﬁc needle through intact skin [3].
•	PICCs are placed via a peripheral vein (i.e. basilica vein, bra-
chial vein or less frequently cephalic vein) of the arm into the superior vena cava (SVC). Their main limitation is shorter longevity, due to a higher risk of thrombosis.
The main sites for central venous access devices are the internal jugular, external jugular and sub-clavian veins. Other potential
 
access sites include: the cephalic vein in the deltopectoral groove, axillary vein and femoral vein. There is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend a speciﬁc insertion site, but the femoral vein should be avoided unless there is a contraindication to the other sites (e.g. SVC syndrome), due to the increased risk of infection and concerns about thrombosis [I, A] [1, 4].
Careful preoperative assessment is advised. This should include the patient’s medical history, a physical examination and the ap- propriate laboratory and radiological tests (discussed below).
Insertion of an implantable venous access device should be carried out under strict sterile conditions, in the operating room [II, B] [5, 6] and under local anaesthesia, with or without sedation. Chlorhexidine solutions with alcohol should be used [I, A] [7, 8].
Antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent catheter colonisation, before insertion or during maintenance of CVCs, is not recom- mended [I, A] [9, 10].
Initial venous access can be carried out by using either the open or the percutaneous approach [11]. The open technique (cephalic vein cut-down) is the best approach to avoid the risk of immediate complications [IV, D] [12]. Randomised, controlled trials comparing 2D ultrasound to the surface landmark ap- proach, for locating the internal jugular vein, report a higher ﬁrst insertion attempt success rate, for 2D ultrasound [II, C] [13]. The data in the literature are equivocal on sub-clavian vein access [II, C] [14] and insufﬁcient for femoral vein access [III, D].
Catheter tip position should be veriﬁed radiologically with an
intraoperative ﬂuoroscopy, or a post-operative chest X-ray [II, B] [15]. The desired location of the catheter tip is at the junction between the right atrium and SVC. An alternative to radiologic conﬁrmation is the intracavitary electrocardiogram (ECG) method, where arrhythmia is documented during insertion of the wire [V, D] [16].
After the procedure, patients require 4 hourly observations in- cluding: temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate. A chest X-ray is required if the patient has dyspnoea or chest wall pain [II, C] [17–19]. Implantable devices only require post insertion care until the incision has healed. Routine ﬂushing

pling, is recommended [II, B] [1, 20].
To maintain patency of subcutaneous ports that are not in active use, a four weekly ﬂush is recommended [III, C] [1, 20]. For tunnelled cuffed catheters and PICC lines, a weekly ﬂush is

also recommended [III, C]. There are some reports supporting an extended time for port ﬂushing, i.e. every 8 weeks or every 3–4 months [21–23]. More research should be done to prospect- ively access the best time interval. An ongoing study is compar- ing ﬂushing every 3 months to every 4-6 weeks (clinicaltrials. gov. Study NCT01047644).

immediate complications
Immediate complications occur at the time of the procedure, and usually consist of injury to the surrounding vital structures or malpositioning of the catheter tip. The most frequent imme- diate complications include: cardiac arrhythmia (23%–25%), ac- cidental arterial puncture (0%–15%), haemothorax (0.1%–11%), pneumothorax (1%–4%) and air embolism (rare) [24].
In speciﬁc immediate complications, the following manage- ment is recommended:
•	Cardiac arrhythmia: occurs during insertion if the catheter is fed too far in. Arrhythmias will be seen on the ECG monitor and corrected by pulling the catheter back.
•	Accidental arterial perforation: remove the cannula and apply
ﬁrm pressure for 10 min, monitor the neurological, haemo- dynamic and airway parameters during this time.
•	Haemothorax: insertion of a large-bore chest tube to drain
pleural blood is the mainstay of therapy for haemothorax [25, 26]. Thoracotomy is reserved for patients with a massive hae- mothorax [26, 27].
•	Pneumothorax, diagnosed and conﬁrmed with a chest X-ray:
in patients with no spontaneous recovery, a chest tube should be inserted to facilitate drainage [28].
•	Air embolism: immediately place the patient in the lateral
decubitus head down position and deliver 100% oxygen [29].
•	Catheter tip migration or breakage and migration: immediate management by interventional radiology for repositioning or removal.

CVC-related infection
The presence of an intravascular foreign body with direct com- munication to the outside environment will increase the patient’s risk of infection. Infection remains the most common complication in cancer patients with indwelling CVCs [30]. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) contribute to treatment delays, reduced doses of chemotherapeutics and con- sequently suboptimal treatment, prolonged hospitalisations, higher mortality rate and increased costs of care [31, 32].
A CVC infection is deﬁned as any infection related to a vascu- lar catheter, including local (at the insertion site) and systemic infections (bloodstream), which have positive cultures [33]. A CRBSI is a primary blood stream infection (BSI) that occurs when bacteria enters the bloodstream through the central line. In the United States, the reported rate of CRBSI in patients with cancer is 1.5 per 1000 CVC/days, with a mortality rate of 12%– 25% [31, 34]. A recent retrospective analysis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Programme [35] conducted in cancer patients over 65 years of age, revealed a threefold increase in infection risk when compared with previously reported litera- ture. This risk was independent of patient, disease and treatment
 
characteristics. Additionally, as has been reported in previous studies, lower infection rates were seen in patients with implanted catheters versus tunnelled catheters and PICCs.
CRBSI is the most common cause of nosocomial bacteraemia [36]. Every year, almost 6000 patients in the UK acquire a CRBSI [30, 37]. The risks for acquiring a CRBSI can be endogenous, such as patient age, disease background and comorbidities or exogenous, such as the type of CVC used and the insertion technique applied [37]. A study by Mollee et al. [38] of 727 patients revealed an overall CRBSI rate of 2.5 per 1000 line/days. It is noted that differ- ent types of CVCs are associated with different levels of infection risk: implantable ports have the lowest incidence of CRBSI; the highest incidence of infection is found in non-tunnelled CVCs. In addition to the type of CVC used, the patients’ diagnosis can be an added risk factor. For example, patients diagnosed with aggressive haematological malignancies are associated with the highest risk of BSI [38]. Overall, CRBSI occur in 3% of catheterisations; however, the incidence may be as high as 16% [36]. In a study by Toure et al. [39], which evaluated 315 consecutive patients, CRBSI occurred in 41 patients (13%). This study elicited four independent risk factors: World Health Organisation performance status, pancreatic cancer, parenteral nutrition administration and cumulative catheter utilisa- tion-days in the previous month. Finally, a recent case–control study [40] that included patients with solid tumours and only implantable central venous ports identiﬁed prolonged catheter stay as a risk factor for port-related BSI infections.
For short-term CVCs (<30 days of dwell time), the major cause of CRBSI is the migration of skin microorganisms from the insertion site along the external surface of the catheter. For long-term CVC, the hub and the lumen of the CVC is the most common source of infection. The colonising microorganisms embed themselves in a microbial bioﬁlm within 48–72 h of in- sertion. They may develop resistance to traditional systemic antibiotics, becoming difﬁcult to eradicate and a recurrent cause of CRBSI [31].
Historically, the most common BSI pathogens were Gram- negative bacteria. Due to the widespread use of indwelling cathe- ters over the past three decades, the proportion of Gram-positive microorganisms has risen in most cancer centres. Gram-positive
bacteria cause ∼60% of BSIs, Gram-negative bacteria account for
∼25% and fungi around 10% [41]. CRBSI are most frequently caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus
and Candida spp. [2]. The less frequent pathogens are: Bacillus spp., enterococci, mycobacteria and non-lactose fermenting Gram- negative bacilli [2].


diagnosis of CVC infections
CVCs infections can be classiﬁed into:
•	Localised infections in the entrance of the catheter.
•	Infections of the tunnel/port-pocket.
•	CRBSI [2].
It is rare that the infusate is the source of infection. Possible compli- cations due to haematogenous seeding are: endocarditis, suppura- tive thrombosis, osteomyelitis and metastatic site infections.
Clinical manifestations of CVC infection may include: fever, inﬂammation or purulence at the insertion site (erythema,
tenderness, pain, induration and drainage), catheter dysfunc- tion, hypotension, chills and signs of sepsis of sudden onset, after catheter use.
In the diagnostic assessment, blood cultures are indicated before starting antibiotic treatment [I, A] [2]. If CRBSI is sus- pected, paired blood samples should be obtained (acquiring the same volume of blood) from the catheter and from a peripheral vein [II, A] [2]. If it is not possible to acquire peripheral vein cultures, two blood samples should be drawn (at different times) from two different catheter lumens [III, B] [2]. There is no good evidence to recommend collecting cultures from all catheter lumens [III, C]. When preparing the skin (and CVC ports) to collect cultures, alcohol, iodine tincture or alcoholic chlorhexi- dine (10.5%) should be used, rather than povidone–iodine [I, A] [2]. It is important to leave adequate time for the skin to dry in order to avoid blood contamination [I, A] [2].
If there is exudate at the exit site of the catheter, a swab should be taken of the exudate for culture and gram staining [III, B] [2]. When the catheter is removed, the catheter tip should be cultured rather than the subcutaneous segment. For subcutaneous ports, a culture of the material inside the port res- ervoir should be included, as it is more sensitive than the cath- eter tip culture. The most reliable diagnostic techniques are semiquantitative (roll plate) or quantitative catheter culture (luminal ﬂushing or sonication methods).
CRBSI is considered, in cases of BSI, when there are no other sources of bacteraemia and there has been a CVC in situ for longer than 2 days. Microbiological results will reveal either a positive culture of the same organism from the catheter tip or at least one percutaneous blood culture [I, A]. They could also reveal a culture of the same organism, from at least two blood samples (catheter hub and peripheral vein) on quantitative blood cultures or criteria meeting differential time to positivity (DTP) [II, A] [2, 42].
The criteria for CRBSI in quantitative blood cultures is a colony count from the catheter hub sample ≥3-fold higher than
the colony count from the peripheral vein sample (or a second lumen) [43]. If semiquantitative cultures are used, the result should be >15 CFU/ml of the same microbe from the insertion site, hub site and peripheral blood culture. When quantitative cultures are not available, DTP should be applied, i.e. growth from the catheter hub at least 2 h before growth detected from the peripheral vein sample [2]. Sensitivity for this diagnostic test has been reported to be 85% with a speciﬁcity of 91% [44].

treatment of CVC infections
Treatment decisions should take into account: the patient’s disease status, comorbidities, the type of catheter, exit site infec- tion or CRBSI, previous exposure to antibiotics, severity of mye- losuppression and signs of tunnel or port infection (Figure 1).
Empiric antibiotic therapy should be started when there are clinical signs of infection. Antibiotic therapy onset should not be delayed for blood culture results to be available. Since the most frequent infectious agents are Staphylococcus coagulase- negative and S. aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA), the recom- mended treatment is vancomycin [II, A] [45–48]. Daptomycin can be used in cases of higher risk for nephrotoxicity or in high prevalence of MRSA strains, with vancomycin minimum
 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥2 μg/ml [II, A] [49–51]. Linezolide is not recommended for empirical use [I, A] [2].
In cases that present with severe symptoms (sepsis, neutropae- nia), empirical use of anti-Gram-negative bacilli antibiotics, such as fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenem or β-lactam/ β-lactamase combinations with or without an aminoglycoside, is recommended [II, A]. The selection of the type of antibiotic should be guided by the antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data of each institution [II, A] [2].
Drug resistance is a signiﬁcant problem and is an important risk factor especially in patients with haematological conditions, the severely immunocompromised and those who have had prolonged exposure to antibiotic therapy. The most frequent pathogens in this setting are Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. [41, 52]. In cases identiﬁed to be at risk of colonisation by a drug-resistant pathogen, the ap- propriate treatment is recommended (please refer to Table 1) [II, A] [2]. For example, known risk factors for carbapenem re- sistance are: older age, prolonged neutropaenia, presence of indwelling CVC, haematological malignancy, previous use of cefepime and total parenteral nutrition [III, C]. In this scenario, combined based therapy is recommended [54–56].
The recommended empirical treatment of candidaemia in critically ill patients is an Echinocandin (caspofungin, micafun- gin, anidulafungin), if one of the following risk factors is present: haematological malignancy, a recent bone marrow transplant or a solid organ transplant, presence of femoral catheters, colonisation of Candida spp. at multiple sites or prolonged use of broad spec- trum antibiotics [III, A] [2, 57, 58]. Fluconazole can be used if the patient is clinically stable, has had no exposure to azoles in the previous 3 months and if the risk of C. krusei or C. glabrata col- onisation is low [III, A] [2, 59].
In cases of neutropaenia, antibiotic treatment recommenda- tions should follow published guidelines for this setting [60].
Once empirical treatment has been initiated the following steps are recommended:
•	Decide if the indwelling catheter should be removed or pre- served.
•	Tailor antibiotic treatment to culture results (see Table 1).
•	Decide on treatment duration.

indications for CVC removal
Removal of the CVC is indicated at the diagnosis of [II, A] [2]:
•	severe sepsis
•	suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis
•	endocarditis
•	tunnel infection
•	port abscess
•	BSI which continues despite 48–72 h of adequate coverage; or infections with S. aureus, fungi or mycobacteria.
Pathogens which have a high risk for infection recurrence and may need catheter removal are: Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium jeikeium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas spp, and Enterococcus resistant to vancomycin [61–63]. In patients where catheter salvage is attempted, antibiotic lock therapy (ALT), in
addition to systemic therapy, is indicated [II, B] [2, 64]. There is less clear evidence for the efﬁcacy of the administration of antibio- tics through the colonised catheter, instead of ALT [III, C] [2].

antibiotic lock therapy
ALT is the instillation of highly concentrated antibiotic (100– 1000 times planktonic MIC) in the CVC, in order to achieve therapeutic concentrations sufﬁcient to eliminate the susceptible pathogens in the bioﬁlm. Usually, the solution is combined with an anticoagulant [low-dose heparin or ion chelators, such as citrate or ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)] that will be dwelling or ‘locked’ in the catheter whenever it is not in use.
ALT is indicated for the prevention and treatment of CVC infections. When ALT is used to treat infection, no signs of exit site or tunnel infection should exist [II, B] [2, 64, 65]. If peripheral blood cultures are negative and the isolated pathogens from the catheter are Staphylococcus coagulase-negative or Gram-negative, ALT can be used on its own. Otherwise, in cases of proven CRBSI, ALT is to be used in combination with systemic antibiotic therapy throughout the duration of the systemic treatment.
Success rates of catheter salvage are reported to be 77% [64, 65]. Some studies show that early initiation of ALT (ﬁrst 48–72 h) is associated with better outcomes, in terms of infection compli- cations and catheter salvage [66]. Treatment duration has been
 
recommended to be 7–14 days [III, B] [2], but some authors suggest a shorter course of therapy (72 h) [67]. Ideally dwell time should be ≥12 h (minimum of 8 h per day) [III, C] [64, 68]
and should not exceed 48 h before reinstallation [2].
Systemic exposure to higher levels of the solution components (mainly if it is ﬂushed and not locked) is a potential risk as- sociated with ALT. Other side-effects include: ototoxicity asso- ciated with aminoglycoside use, bleeding after higher exposure to anticoagulants (heparin 1000 units/ml or citrate 30%–46.7%), hypocalcaemia and arrhythmias (associated with higher concen- trations of citrate), catheter occlusion and increased risk of anti- biotic resistance [64]. A recent meta-analysis [69] revealed that anticoagulant citrate is associated with higher efﬁcacy in the pre- vention of CRBSI and a lower risk of bleeding compared with heparin, but there is a higher risk of arrhythmias due to induced hypocalcaemia. Currently, a lower concentration (solution of citrate 4%) is recommended and is available in Europe [70, 71]. The beneﬁts of ALT outweigh the reported risks, but local proto- cols for ALT use should be carefully implemented.


treatment duration
The duration of treatment will depend on the response to treat- ment in the ﬁrst 48 or 72 h (i.e. resolution of clinical symptoms
and negative cultures), the type of pathogen and the presence of complications. In most cases, 10–14 days of treatment is recom- mended after signs of infection have resolved [2] (the day of the ﬁrst negative cultures is day one)—‘see speciﬁc pathogens’. If positive cultures are present 72 h after catheter removal or when complications occur [i.e. endocarditis or suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis], 4–6 weeks of treatment is recommended [II, A for S. aureus infection; III, C for infection due to other patho- gens]. In case of osteomyelitis, treatment should be 6–8 weeks in duration [II, A] [2].

staphylococcus coagulase-negative
This is the most frequent and more benign pathogen associated with CRBSI, except for S. lugdunensis which should be managed as a S. aureus infection. Since it is the most frequent contamin- ant, diagnosis should be based on more than one set of positive blood cultures, and preferentially from the catheter and periph- eral vein [II, A] [2]. If there are no complications attempts should be made to salvage the catheter with systemic antibiotic therapy for 10–14 days, including ALT [II, B] [2] (see Table 1). A recent meta-analysis shows that the beneﬁt of ALT is higher for this pathogen, with more data available on the use of dapto- mycin [53]. If the catheter is removed antibiotic treatment should be continued for 5–7 days [2, 31].

staphylococcus aureus
The mortality of patients with S. aureus bacteraemia is increasing over time, as is the prevalence of MRSA infections [Methicillin- sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) increased from 3.6% to 51.7%, and MRSA from 0% to 83.3% between 1980 and 2000] [72]. Staphylococcus aureus infections are more frequent in older people and most commonly caused by colonisation of intravenous catheters [73]. The strongest predictors for mortality are pneumo- nia and the absence of an identiﬁed infective focus. Other predic- tors are inadequate antimicrobial therapy and identiﬁcation and
 
removal of the infective focus. The presence of: malignancy, dia- betes, high serum glucose level, methicillin resistance, serum albumin level, interleukin-10 and C-reactive protein are also con- sidered risk factors, but need to be prospectively validated [74].
In cases of S. aureus infection, the catheter should be removed
and antibiotic systemic therapy implemented [II, B] [2, 31] (see Table 1). Treatment should proceed for a minimum of 14 days (when there is a response), and 4–6 weeks in cases of haema- togenous complications or persistent bacteraemia after catheter removal [II, B] [2, 31]. Due to the high risk of endocarditis (25%–32%), a trans-oesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is indi- cated unless, at 72 h after catheter removal, cultures and clinical assessments are negative [2, 75, 76]. TTE should be carried out at 5–7 days after the onset of bacteraemia [III, B]. The known risk factors for haematogenous complications [77] are: prosthetic intra- vascular devices, cardiac valvular disease, immune-compromising conditions (diabetes, medications, acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome), delayed catheter removal and suppurative thrombo- phlebitis. The success rate for ALT is low and it should only be used if there are major contraindications for catheter removal such as no alternative venous access, bleeding diathesis or quality-of-life issues related to changing the catheter to a differ- ent location. If used, ALT should be combined with systemic therapy for at least 4 weeks [II, B] [2, 31, 76]. Adjunctive rifam- picin in S. aureus bacteraemia in the mechanism of enhanced early bacterial killing is currently being studied in a randomised trial [78]. For antibiotic treatment, see Table 1.


enterococcus
European data reveal that enterococcus bacteraemia is respon- sible for 7.2% of BSI [79]. A recent Spanish study evaluated the incidence of BSI by this pathogen (over an 8-year period) and found that it was responsible for 6% of all episodes, with a 17% increase of the annual incidence (95% conﬁdence interval 19%– 21%) [80]. In cases of Enterococcus infection, the catheter can be
retained and systemic antibiotic therapy is recommended [II, B] [2, 31]. The preferred antibiotic is ampicillin, but vancomycin should be used in cases of resistance [III, A] [2]. In third-line treatment linezolid or daptomycin are recommended and should be used according to AST data [II, B] [2]. Combination therapy is not superior to monotherapy, unless it is used in an attempt to salvage the catheter. In this case, systemic antibiotic therapy (gentamicin+ampicillin) should be combined with ALT. The duration of treatment should be 7–14 days, if no endo- carditis or metastatic infection sites are present. The risk of endocarditis is higher with Enterococcus faecalis than with
E. faecium, but TEE should only be carried out if clinical signs
of endocarditis are present [III, B] [2, 81].

gram-negative bacillus
Systemic antibiotic therapy is indicated [II, A] [2] (see Table 1). If catheter salvage is attempted ALT should be used [III, C] [2]. Combined antibiotic therapy should be used in patients with recent infection or colonisation with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria [II, A] [2]. There is concern about the emergent resistance of Gram-negative bacillus in haematology patients. A recent prospective cohort study of 574 BSI in Italian haematology patients, showed Enterobacteriaceae resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in 36.9%, K. pneumoniae-resistant strains to carbapenems in 34.9% and P. aeruginosa isolates MDR in 69.7% [52].

candida
Candidaemia has mainly been studied in haematology patients
[82] (leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome represent 40%– 50% of malignancies with invasive fungal diseases), but there are also reports in solid tumours [83]. Besides malignancy, other identiﬁed risk factors were: the presence of CVCs, neutropaenia, immunosuppressive agents, broad spectrum antibiotic use and parenteral nutrition. There is a 30% association with bacter- aemia, mainly antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistance enterococci, extended spectrum β-lactase Escherichia coli and MDR A. baumannii [83–85]. Additionally,
 
mortality has been reported at 30%–50% [57, 85–87]. Most cases are related to Candida albicans [88], but there is a tendency for an increase in non-albicans as well as resistance to azoles [57, 84]. When fungi infection is present, the CVC should be removed [II, A] [2] and anti-fungal therapy should be initiated [II, A] (see Table 1). Some evidence reveals an improved survival when these measures are implemented in the ﬁrst 48–72 h [III, A] [66, 89]. Amphotericin is less used because of issues surrounding toxicity and it having a similar efﬁcacy to echinocandins [58]. Although limited data are available, ALT demonstrates the best results when used with amphotericin, ethanol or echinocandins, but
generally ALT is not effective in Candida CRBSI [III, C] [2, 90].

prevention of CVC-related infections
CRBSI is an iatrogenic problem that causes signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. CRBSIs are responsible for longer lengths of hospital stays and increased treatment costs [37]. The adherence to prevent- ive measures has a signiﬁcant impact on reducing the risk of CVC- related infections [31]. The 2011 update of the Centre for Disease Control guidelines, for the prevention of intravascular catheter- related infections, introduces several recommendations, including speciﬁc instructions on: the size of catheter implantation, dressing, protective clothing, handling and maintenance of the CVCs [4].
The main strategies for the prevention of CRBSIs are [I, A] [33, 91]:
•	Education and ongoing training of health care personnel who insert and maintain catheters.
•	Use of maximal sterile barrier precautions during CVC inser-
tion.
•	Use of >0.5% chlorhexidine skin preparation with alcohol for antisepsis.
•	Avoidance of routine replacement of CVCs as a strategy to
prevent infection.
•	Use of antiseptic/antibiotic-impregnated short-term CVCs and chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge dressings, if the rate of infection is not decreasing despite adherence to other strat- egies.
 

•	Implementation of bundled strategies, including documenting and reporting rates of compliance of all components of the bundle, as benchmarks for quality assurance and performance improvement.
•	Implementation of appropriate patient education programmes,
which include instructions on hand decontamination and the prevention of cross-contamination in patients with stomas [1, 2].
It is routine practice to ﬂush tunnelled cuffed catheters and PICC lines weekly, and subcutaneous ports 4-weekly (when not in use), using heparin or normal saline 0.9% solution. An aseptic tech- nique by hospital-trained nurses, which includes the use of alco- holic chlorhexidine 2% cleanser, to decontaminate catheter hubs before use, should be used [37, 92].
There is emergent evidence that the new generation of needle- less connectors, which have mechanical valves that generate negative, positive or neutral pressure during disconnection, is associated with increased rates of CRBSI, mostly in intensive care units, but also oncology units [93–95]. The utilisation of neutral pressure mechanical valve connectors to avoid the risk of infection is recommended [III, C].
The use of antibiotic-coated catheters, which can be impregnated with antiseptics (chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine) or antimicro- bials (minocycline/rifampin), has shown some advantage over non-coated CVCs in published systematic reviews [96, 97]. Due to methodological issues in these studies, however, a strong recom- mendation for their use is not warranted [II, B], although they could be useful in institutions where there are high rates of BSIs.
ALT solutions have been proposed in cases with a history of multiple CRBSI (despite appropriate CRBSI prevention measures) when the catheter is projected to remain in situ for longer than 7–8 weeks [II, B] [4]. The decision to use ALT should always take into account the possible side-effects discussed in the ALT
 
section of this guideline. Chelator-based antimicrobial locks, in particular the combination of EDTA/minocycline, have been proven to be effective in patients with cancer and in patients on haemodialysis who have long-term CVCs [98–100]. The add- ition of 25% ethanol to a minocycline/EDTA lock solution demonstrated high efﬁcacy in eradicating pathogens in the bioﬁlm and high clinical efﬁcacy in salvaging CVCs. Nitroglycerine citrate lock, which is a non-antibiotic chelator lock, also has proven efﬁcacy [101]. More recently, a meta-analysis [102] assessed 2896 patients (the majority undergoing haemodialysis but some studies included oncology patients), showing that ALT was re- sponsible for a 69% reduction of CRBSI, when compared with heparin. There was no change in the all-cause mortality and no difference among the antimicrobial solutions used. A Cochrane review on prophylactic antibiotics in oncology patients with long- term CVCs [10] also showed that ﬂushing or locking with a com- bined antibiotic and heparin solution signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of CRBSI Gram-positive sepsis.


catheter-induced thrombosis
Apart from infections, the main complication of CVCs is throm- bosis [103]. Patients with cancer have a ﬁve to seven times ele- vated risk of thrombosis. The underlying causes are: activation of the coagulation cascade by cancer cells (increase of plasma thrombin levels and activity), decreased levels of coagulation inhi- bitors, impaired ﬁbrinolysis, increased antiphospholipid anti- bodies, activated protein C-resistance and enhanced platelet aggregation [104]. Training of health care personnel, as well as appropriate patient education, is fundamental to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Risk reduction of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) is important because VTEs are a detrimental factor for cancer survival [105]. CVC-related thrombosis (CRT) is detected
 


in 27%–66% of cancer patients when they are screened by venog- raphy [106], with only 0.5%–28% of these cases having symptoms [62]. In the last few years, a downward trend of symptomatic CRT has been noted, with a reported average rate of 4%–8%, this is mainly due to improvements in the catheter material used, sur- gical techniques and catheter maintenance [62].
There are different types of thrombotic complications asso- ciated with CVCs. Major complication occurs when the throm- bosis, involving the vein in which the catheter is inserted, leads to serious systemic and life-threatening sequelae, such as pul- monary embolism and sepsis. Minor complications include: ball-valve-type clot on the tip of the catheter; lumen obstruction; ﬁbrin sheath along the length of the catheter and superﬁcial thrombophlebitis. These complications are usually associated with local symptoms or may interfere with the infusion or aspir- ation from the catheter [107].
There are broadly three main causes of CVC occlusions: mech- anical, thrombotic and medication/parenteral nutrition-related. Several mechanical causes can lead to a blockage: kink in catheter, tight suture, huber needle dislodge or occlusion, the catheter tip being blocked by the vessel wall and pinch-off syndrome (com- pression of the catheter, caused by its passage through the narrow angle between the ﬁrst rib and the lateral portion of the clavicle). The latter complication is more frequent when the sub-clavian vein is used for access. These risks can be reduced if an ultra- sound-guided technique is carried out [108]. Inappropriate con- centration or inadequate mixture can cause the precipitation of medications in the catheter lumen (low or high pH, calcium phosphate precipitate, lipid emulsion, high-osmolarity and high-protein nutrition formulas) [109]. Furthermore, thrombot- ic aetiology could be related to ﬁbrin sheath, intraluminal clot, mural or venous thrombosis [110].

risk factors
Potential risk factors for catheter-related thrombosis are listed in Table 2 [106, 111–124].

diagnosis of catheter-induced thrombosis
CVC-related symptoms are often non-speciﬁc. Therefore, a clin- ical diagnosis is possible in only 40%–47% of cases [125]. Frequently in clinical practice, the ﬁrst signs are: difﬁculty
 
aspirating or infusing through the lumen of the catheter, and complaints of local pain or a burning sensation during injection. Other common signs are redness, swelling and oedema. Complications are: infections, blockage of the lumen, circulatory obstruction and thromboembolism. Pulmonary embolism at presentation is rare. Although venography is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of CRT, Doppler ultrasound is usually carried out [III, A], because it is readily available and non-inva- sive (sensitivity 56%–100%; speciﬁcity 94%–100%) [125–127]. In patients with suspected CRT and a normal ultrasound, or sus- pected central venous occlusion, venography or alternative imaging should be carried out [magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography (CT), gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance venography or contrast-enhanced CT] [III, A] [110].

treatment of catheter-induced thrombosis
When the CVC is no longer necessary, or if long-term anticoa- gulation is contraindicated, a short course (3–5 days) of anticoa- gulation therapy is recommended before removing the catheter, in order to avoid clot embolisation [I, A] [110, 128]. The length of therapy after removal of CVCs has not been established with certainty. According to the severity of thrombosis, 3 months of therapy is usually advised, with some authors suggesting even shorter courses [I, C] [128, 129]. Additionally, if symptoms pro- gress or the blood clot extends into the SVC, the CVC should be removed. If the device remains in situ and the patient is not at risk of complications, anticoagulation drugs should be adminis- tered [III, C] [130]. Anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and vitamin K antagonist can be used [128]. Warfarin can cause complications in cancer patients (e.g. interference between warfarin dosage and some chemotherapy drugs, thrombocytopaenia, nutritional status, metastatic liver disease) [62]. LMWH is more effective in preventing thrombotic recurrences [II, A] [131]: LMWH alone or LMWH followed by warfarin therapy should be used for a minimum of 3–6 months [132]. There are no data for the use of new oral anticoagulants, neither for prevention nor for therapy [133]. It is recommended to continue anticoagulation therapy at a prophylactic dose, until the catheter is in place [I, C] [134]. A comparison of the different guidelines recommendations, for the treatment and the prophylaxis of catheter-related thrombosis, are listed in Tables 3 and 4.
thrombolytic (urokinase, streptokinase and alteplase) treat- ment is not recommended as a ﬁrst-line therapy, due to a greater risk of thrombosis [I, B] [128]. If used, urokinase 5000 IE should be administered and dwell within the catheter for 1 h, before it is aspirated. This procedure can be repeated several times. Alternatively, alteplase 2 mg/2 ml can be administered twice (as- piration after 60 min). Additional treatment options are: SVC ﬁlter, mechanical thrombectomy, venous angioplasty and surgical decompression.
In summary, published data and clinical experience suggest that:
•	catheter-related thrombosis is associated with a low risk for recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome and, therefore, conservative treatment is recommended,
•	removal of the CVC is required in cases of concomitant deep
vein thrombosis, sepsis, non-functioning or if central access is not necessary,
•	either LMWH alone or LMWH followed by warfarin should
be used for a minimum of 3–6 months.

 
prevention
Extensive, routine prophylaxis with anticoagulants to prevent CRT is not recommended [I, A] [137, 138]. The use of thrombolytic agents (e.g. urokinase) shows inconclusive results in different trials, and there are insufﬁcient data for it to be recommended [139, 140]. New materials, such as ionic implantation of silicone chromic venous access devices and silver-coated CVCs, have not been shown to relevantly affect rates of thrombosis [62]. In crit- ically ill patients, heparin-bonded CVCs have been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of CRT and infection, but data for oncological patients are lacking.
Intermittent ﬂushing with heparin is a standard practice in the maintenance of CVC patency. However, when compared with 0.9% normal saline ﬂushing, no differences in thrombosis rates were found [I, C] [20, 141]. Prevention of catheter occlu- sion by heparin installation is widely discussed. If used, unfrac- tionated heparin (>500 IE) should be administered.
In cancer patients, thromboprophylaxis with warfarin or LMWH has provided inconclusive results in outpatients. Two large prospective trials, PROTECHT [142] (daily nadroparin) and SAVE-ONCO [143] (daily semuloparin) evaluated the use of LMWH in cancer patients. Despite the fact that thrombopro- phylaxis appears to be effective, safe and feasible, the event rate was low (PROTECHT: 2% in the treatment group versus 3.9% in the placebo group; SAVE-ONCO: 1.2% in the treatment group versus 3.4% in the placebo group). Therefore, the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with cancer should be accurately evaluated, balancing potential risks and beneﬁts in every single case [144].
