incidence and epidemiology
Classical hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is a B-cell chronic lympho- proliferative disorder characterised by splenomegaly, pancytopae- nia and bone marrow involvement with ﬁbrosis. HCL represents 2% of adult leukaemia. Approximately 1600 new cases per year are diagnosed in Europe [1], with a median age of 52 years at the time of diagnosis. The disease occurs more often in men than in women, with a ratio of approximately 4:1 [2]. In the USA, a higher frequency of HCL is observed among white Americans than among African-Americans or Asians, as well as in patients following exposure to the herbicide ‘Agent Orange’, used during the Vietnam War [3]. HCL variant (HCL-V) is classiﬁed among the unclassiﬁable splenic B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma that is no longer biologically related to classical HCL. It is included in the World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation as a provisional entity [4]. HCL-V is an uncommon disorder, accounting for ap- proximately 0.4% of chronic lymphoid malignancies and 10% of all HCL cases, without sexual predominance. The median age of the patients is 71 years.

diagnosis and pathology/molecular biology
The examination of peripheral blood ﬁlms and immunopheno- typing allows for a diagnosis to be established in most cases (Table 1) [I, C] [5, 6]. The neoplastic cells are twice the size of a lymphocyte and have a round or kidney-shaped nucleus with loose chromatin and abundant pale cytoplasm with projections. Monocytopaenia and macrocytosis are very common; other cytopaenias may be present. A diagnosis of HCL based on cy- tology can be effectively conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry studies using anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies such as CD19, CD20 or CD22, together with a panel of antibodies such as CD11c, CD25, CD103 and CD123, which are more speciﬁc to HCL; this
 
combination will allow for the differentiation of HCL from other B-cell leukaemias and lymphomas with circulating villous cells [5, 6]. In addition, strong expression of CD200 is character- istic of HCL and may be useful for the diagnosis in difﬁcult cases [7].
HCL-V typically presents with high lymphocyte counts, with the cells being nucleolated and lacking monocytopaenia. Flow cytometry will indicate the cells to be CD11c+ and often CD103
+ but very rarely CD25+ and CD123+. There is an overlap with splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma, and distinguishing between these two diseases may be difﬁcult. A bone marrow examination is required for the diagnosis, particularly after treatment, to assess response [I, C].
As the bone marrow can rarely be aspirated (‘dry-tap’) in clas-
sical HCL, diagnosis is typically performed by a bone marrow trephine biopsy. The degree and pattern of inﬁltration varies from mild interstitial to diffuse, and the lymphoid cells are sur- rounded by a clear halo due to the abundant cytoplasm, giving the characteristic ‘fried egg’ pattern. In HCL-V, the inﬁltration is either intrasinusoidal or interstitial.
Immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibodies CD20, CD72 (DBA44), CD11c, CD25, CD103, annexin A1 and tartrate- resistant acid phosphatase stain will highlight the lymphoid inﬁl- trates and support the diagnosis of classical HCL [6]. However, annexin A1 is not suitable for detecting residual disease after treatment as it stains myeloid cells also. Cyclin D1 may be weakly positive but differential diagnosis with mantle cell lymphoma rarely arises. Recently, monoclonal antibodies that detect the mutated BRAF protein have been developed and shown to be useful for the diagnosis and detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) [8]. Although this requires validation, prelimin- ary data suggest that this marker has high speciﬁcity and sensi- tivity for HCL [II, C].
The main distinguishing features between HCL and HCL-V are outlined in Table 2. HCL does not have a distinct chromo-
 
 		somal abnormality. The majority of the cases have mutations

as well as the presence of lymphadenopathy, which predicts a poor response to purine analogues [15]. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) have a signiﬁcantly longer disease-free survival than those who achieve a partial response (PR) [II, B] [16]. Biological factors that have been associated with a poor outcome are the presence of TP53 mutations and the lack of somatic mutations in the IGVH genes, which occur in a minor proportion of cases [IV, C] [10] and the VH4-34 family usage, a feature more frequent in HCL-V [11]. The presence of TP53 mutations (but not VH4-34) usage appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in HCL-V [IV, C] [13].

 















repertoires or stereotypes in HCL [9–11]. In 2011, Tiacci et al.
[12] reported the presence of the V600E mutation of the BRAF gene in exon 15 in all 47 investigated HCL cases. The mutation rarely occurs in exon 11. The BRAF mutation leads to the activa- tion of the RAF/MEK-ERK pathway, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation and survival. These results have been validated by other groups and new simpler and more sensitive methods to detect the mutation, such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) have been developed. This ﬁnding is rele- vant to the diagnosis and pathogenesis of HCL with potential therapeutic implications. In the near future, testing for this muta- tion may be incorporated on a routine basis into the diagnostic work-up of HCL [II, C]. Although HCL-V patients lack the BRAF mutation, TP53 mutations are present in one-third of cases [13].

staging and risk stratiﬁcation
There is no worldwide accepted staging system for HCL. In add- ition to the diagnostic tests on the blood and bone marrow tre- phine biopsy, a staging work-up should include full blood cell counts with differential and reticulocytes, renal and liver bio- chemistry, serum immunoglobulins, β2 microglobulin, direct antiglobulin test (DAT), Coombs test and hepatitis virus B and C and human immunodeﬁciency virus screening. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is desirable at the time of diagnosis (as around 10% of HCL patients have abdominal lymphadenop- athy) and should be performed at relapse [14].
There is no international prognostic system for risk stratiﬁca- tion of HCL. Clinical variables that have been considered to have an adverse prognosis include the degree of cytopaenias (Hb < 10 g/dl, platelets < 100 × 109/l) and neutrophils (<1 × 109/l),
 
treatment plan
Treatment is not indicated in asymptomatic patients [V, B]. However, untreated patients should be closely monitored with a complete history, physical examination, and complete blood cell count with a differential test every 3–6 months. In contrast to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, asymptomatic patients, who may be diagnosed by chance, are rare and in practice most patients need treatment shortly after diagnosis, either because of symptoms or to correct cytopaenias including monocytopaenia. Treatment should be initiated in patients with symptomatic disease manifested by bulky or progressive, symptomatic spleno- megaly cytopaenias (haemoglobin <10 g/dl and/or platelets
<100 × 109/l and/or neutrophils <1 × 109/l), recurrent or severe infections and/or systemic symptoms [II, A] [17, 18].

ﬁrst line
purine analogues
Purine analogues, cladribine (2-CldA) or pentostatin (DCF), are recommended as initial treatment of symptomatic HCL patients who are young and ﬁt (Figure 1) [II, A]. 2-CldA induces durable and unmaintained response in 87%–100% patients, including CR in 85%–91%, after a single course of therapy [19]. 2-CldA is administered either as a continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg over a 5–7 day period, or as a 2-h i.v. infu- sion at a dose of 0.12–0.14 mg/kg for 5–7 days [20, 21]. 2-CldA is also an effective drug when administered at a dose of 0.12–0.15 mg/kg in 2-h infusion once a week over 6 courses [I, B] [22, 23]. Both CR and overall response (OR) rates are similar in weekly and daily administration. Neither less frequent infections nor haematological toxicity have been conﬁrmed in the weekly sched- ule by randomised trials [I, B] [23, 24]. Similar results were achieved when the drug was given as a subcutaneous injection [II, B] [24, 25]. A subcutaneous 2-CldA is given at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day for 5–7 days or 0.14 mg/kg/day for 5 days as a single course [24, 25]. Grade 3–4 toxicity, largely represented by neutro- paenic fevers and infections, were less frequent when lower total doses were used (0.5 mg/kg) than higher doses (0.7 mg/kg) with similar OR [25]. Subcutaneous administration does not usually require hospitalisation, and seems to be an easier way of deliver- ing the drug than i.v. administration. Although no randomised trial comparing i.v. versus subcutaneous 2-CldA administration has been performed, the efﬁcacy of both methods is similar [II, B]. A CR following 2-CldA administration is durable even without maintenance therapy [16]. In patients demonstrating a

PR after the ﬁrst course of 2-CldA, a second course should be repeated to achieve a CR at least 6 months after the end of the ﬁrst course, with or without rituximab [IV, B] [26].
Similarly to 2-CldA, DCF induces a high rate of long-lasting CR. In patients with a normal creatinine clearance (>60 ml/min), DCF is usually given at a dose of 4 mg/m2 i.v. every second week until CR, plus one or two consolidating injections [27]. After 8–9 courses, the full blood count usually normalises, and the bone marrow biopsy should be performed to conﬁrm a CR [III, B]. If a CR is documented, one or two further DCF injections are indi- cated [16]. DCF and 2-CldA appear to induce similar high re- sponse rates, duration of response, recurrence rates and adverse events [III, B] [16]. However, no randomised, direct comparison between the two drugs has been performed. The advantage of DCF over interferon-α (IFN-α) in HCL patients has been con- ﬁrmed in a multicentre, randomised trial [I, A] [28]. 2-CldA ad- ministration is more convenient than DCF and is used more frequently.

interferon-α
As purine analogues produce higher and more durable remis- sions, and are more convenient to patients, the use of IFN-α in
 
the treatment of HCL is limited. However, IFN-α may still have a place in the treatment of HCL in pregnancy [V, B]. It can also be used in patients presenting with very severe neutropaenia (neutrophil count <0.2 × 109/l) to increase the neutrophil count prior to nucleoside analogue therapy [V, C] [29].

response evaluation
Responses are deﬁned according to the ‘Consensus Resolution’ criteria (Table 3) [30]. Response evaluation includes careful physical examination and a blood cell count. A marrow biopsy is recommended to establish a CR. A chest X-ray and an abdom- inal ultrasound or CT for response evaluation should be performed. A CR requires the morphological absence of hairy cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration or biopsy specimens, and normalisation of any organomegaly and cytopae- nia. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood or bone marrow is not required but is useful to detect MRD. A PR is deﬁned as normalisation of peripheral counts, associated with at least a 50% reduction in organomegaly and bone marrow hairy cells, and <5% circulating hairy cells. All other outcomes are con- sidered as nonresponse. The eradication of MRD is generally not recommended in routine clinical practice. Assessment of response
 

 


should be performed 4–6 months after treatment with 2-CldA and after 8–9 courses of DCF [31]. Relapse is deﬁned as any de- terioration in blood counts related to the detection of hairy cells in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow.


treatment of relapsed patients and patients refractory to purine analogues
Relapsed patients can be successfully retreated with 2-CldA or DCF if relapse occurs after 12–18 months [IV, B] [32] (Figure 2). The alternative nucleoside analogue can be used in early relapse within 2 years after the ﬁrst-line treatment [31]. The ability to attain CR decreases with each course of therapy, but CR dura- tion appears to be similar after ﬁrst-, second- or third-line therapy [16, 33].
Rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 for 4–8 doses given weekly
as i.v. infusions can be used in early relapsed patients [III, B] [34–36]. However, rituximab alone is inferior to purine analo- gues and is not the treatment of choice as a single agent in relapsed patients. Outcomes for patients with recurrent HCL appear to be better when a combination of rituximab and 2- CldA or DCF is used rather than the purine analogue alone [III, B] [37, 38]. Concurrent therapy of rituximab and a purine ana- logue induces higher response rates, and higher rates of toxic events than in the sequential administration [III, B] [39].
IFN-α is also a possible option for selected patients relapsing after purine analogue therapy [IV, B] [40, 41]. Patients refrac- tory to purine analogue therapy should be enrolled on clinical trials that use new agents, whenever possible. Fludarabine at a dose of 40 mg/m2 oral ( p.o.) for ﬁve consecutive days in com- bination with an i.v. injection of 375 mg/m2 rituximab on day 1, every 28 days for four cycles, can be a therapeutic option in relapsed or refractory patients previously treated with 2-CldA [IV, B]. After a median follow-up of 35 months with 14 progres- sion-free patients, a 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 89%, an overall survival (OS) of 83% and a recurrence rate of 7% were observed in 15 treated patients [42]. Bendamustine at 70–90 mg/m2 combined with rituximab is another therapeutic option in multiply relapsed/refractory HCL, and could be con- sidered in HCL patients after the failure of standard therapies [IV, B] [43].
 
Other promising drugs active in purine analogue refractory HCL patients include moxetumomab pasudotox, an anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin, and vemurafenib, a BRAF V600E inhibitor [44–46]. A phase I trial of moxetumomab pasudotox in relapsed/refractory HCL induced an 86% OR rate, and a 46% CR [44]. However, moxetumomab pasudotox is not licensed in Europe yet.
Vemurafenib also showed remarkable activity in multiply relapsed and refractory HCL patients with rapidly decreased splenomegaly,  increased  platelet  counts  and  normalisation of haemoglobin and granulocyte counts [45, 46]. The optimal dosing and duration of treatment using vemurafenib is un- known. A multicentre, phase II study of vemurafenib in the treatment of refractory HCL is ongoing (NCT01711632). The therapeutic potential of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) in- hibitor ibrutinib also needs to be taken into consideration in a relapse setting, given the proven in vitro activity of this drug in hairy cells [47]. A phase II study with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed HCL is ongoing (NCT01841723).

splenectomy
Splenectomy may be indicated in patients with resistant massive symptomatic splenomegaly (>10 cm below the costal margin) with accompanied low-level bone marrow inﬁltration [IV, B] [48]. OR rates of 60%–100% were documented in eight major reports [29]. Splenectomised patients respond better and faster to the subsequent chemotherapy [V, B]. Splenectomy can also be considered when progressive HCL develops during preg- nancy and in patients refractory to nucleoside analogues and IFN-α [V, B] [29]. Systemic therapy should not be performed earlier than 6 months after splenectomy to reach full beneﬁts of this treatment [31]. Vaccination against Haemophilus inﬂu- enza and pneumococcus before splenectomy is recommended [IV, B] [49].

allogeneic stem cell transplantation
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has a potential role in younger, heavily pretreated HCL patients who have had multiple relapses and are refractory to purine analogues and rituximab [V, C] [50, 51].

treatment during pregnancy
Only a few cases of HCL during pregnancy have been reported [52, 53]. Treatment is indicated only when truly warranted. The appropriate therapy depends on the stage of pregnancy, rate of disease progression and response to previous therapies. If treat- ment is indicated, the lower risks associated with IFN-α for both the mother and the fetus make it the treatment of choice [V, B]. IFN-α shows good tolerance, uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, and normal child development [54]. Splenectomy is another option to consider, should INF-α fail, especially in early gestation when the risks are lower [V, B] [52, 55]. Administration of 2-CldA and rituximab are not indicated in pregnancy because of the risk of teratogenic effects. However, successful pregnancy after the administration of 2-CldA and rituximab has also been reported [56].

supportive treatment
Patients treated with nucleoside analogues and lymphopaenia should receive prophylactic co-trimoxazole 960 mg three times per week and aciclovir (200 mg three times daily) until the lymphocyte count increases to >1 × 109/l to prevent pneumocystis infections and herpes reactivation [IV, B]. Co-trimoxazole and aciclovir prophylaxis should be started one week after purine ana- logue administration to reduce allergic skin reaction [18]. The routine adjunctive use of ﬁlgrastim with 2-CldA in the treatment of patients with HCL and severe neutropaenia is not recom- mended [IV, C] [57]. However, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use should be considered in individual cases with severe neutropaenia and life-threatening infection. Patients treated with 2-CldA or DCF should receive irradiated blood products to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease [58].
 
treatment of HCL-V
The results of the treatment of HCL-V with purine analogues are poor (Figure 3). The analysis of 19 cases treated with 2-CldA showed a response rate of 55%, including only 2 with CR [59]. In addition, the majority of HCL-V patients required more than 1 cycle to maintain a response. DCF induced a PR in only 8 out of 15 (54%) patients and no CR was achieved [60]. Rituximab alone, or splenectomy followed by rituximab therapy, can also induce CR in HCL-V [61, 62]. However, administration of 2-CldA immediately followed by rituximab, typically involving 2-CldA being given at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg on days 1–5, with
8 weekly doses of 375 mg/m2 rituximab beginning day 1, appears to be more effective than 2-CldA alone or rituximab alone and should be considered as the initial treatment of HCL- V patients [IV, B] [38, 63]. In a recent study based on 8 patients,

all achieved a CR, including 7 (88%) with MRD negativity at 12–38 (median 24) months of follow-up. Alternatively, indi- vidual case reports suggest that alemtuzumab is an active agent in treating HCL-V, even in patients who have relapsed after rituximab [64]. Splenectomy induces clinical responses in some patients with HCL-V, and is recommended because it corrects cytopaenias, removes the bulk of the tumour and may improve response to purine nucleoside analogues [V, B] [65]. Splenic irradiation could be performed in elderly patients with a high surgical risk of splenectomy [V, B]. Clinical case reports support the use of moxetumomab pasudotox in patients with HCL-V [V, B] [44]. Some case reports indicate that autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation can be effective in refractory patients [V, B] [66]. However, the data to support these approaches are limited.

personalised medicine
In HCL and HCL-V, more research is needed to identify bio- markers which could be used for medical treatment decisions. Recently, BRAF V600E mutation has been identiﬁed as a charac- teristic biomarker of HCL [III, B] [67–69]. It is present in nearly all cases of HCL but virtually absent in diseases that mimic HCL. In a recent study, a BRAF V600E mutation was detected
 
in 17 (77.3%) of 22 HCL cases by PCR, and was demonstrated in 20 (90.9%) cases using VE1 immunohistochemistry staining [68]. Immunohistochemical detection of BRAF V600E mutant protein is highly sensitive and speciﬁc for the diagnosis of HCL.

follow-up and long-term implications
A follow-up of asymptomatic patients should include a com- plete history, physical examination, a blood cell count and routine chemistry every 3–12 months [II, B]. Regular CT scans are not necessary outside clinical trials. The frequency of second malignancies is increased  in  HCL  patients  whether  treated or untreated. Solid and haematological malignancies develop in 10% of patients after HCL diagnosis, particularly chronic lymphoproliferative diseases (myeloma, Hodgkin’s and non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma), melanoma and thyroid cancer [70, 71].
