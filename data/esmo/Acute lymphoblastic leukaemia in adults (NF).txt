incidence and epidemiology
The estimated overall incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma in Europe is 1.28 per 100 000 individuals annually, with signiﬁcant age-related variations (0.53 at
45–54 years, ∼1.0 at 55–74 years and 1.45 at 75–99 years) and that
of Burkitt leukaemia/lymphoma is between 0.17 and 0.33 in the same age groups [1]. These ﬁgures qualify ALL asa rare disease in adults, making assessment and care at qualiﬁed centres highly de- sirable. Predisposing risk factors for adult ALL are not known, con- trary to childhood ALL [2]. Therapeutic progress is undeniable as shown by large registry data. In Europe, 5-year overall survival (OS) improved from 29.8% in the years 1997–1999 to 41.1% in 2006–2008 (P < 0.0001), still as a function of age. Compared with the reference group (age 15–54 years: OS >50%), OS was <30% in the 55–64 years age group (hazard ratio 2.05) and <20% in the
≥65 years age group (hazard ratios 2.71 and 3.75) [3].
diagnosis and pathology/molecular biology
A comprehensive diagnostic approach requires the study of cell morphology, immunophenotype, genetics/cytogenetics and genomics, as detailed in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation [4] and recently reviewed [I, A] [5, 6].
morphology/immunophenotype/molecular screening
The initial diagnostic work-up (Table 1) must be carried out expeditiously and before any chemotherapy (within 1–2 working days) to:

Aspiration of bone marrow is a standard procedure, with a core marrow biopsy being necessary only in case of insufﬁcient cell yield. The bone marrow must contain at least 20% blast cells, as a criterion to differentiate ALL from lymphoblastic lymphoma with/without marrow involvement, even if therapeutic conse- quences are very limited. The proportion of circulating blasts is highly variable. ALL blasts are atypical lymphoid or undifferen- tiated cells. Once minimally differentiated acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) has been ruled out, the morphological ana- lysis is uninformative in ALL, if not for the common association between FAB L3 morphology and B-ALL [7]. The immunophe- notype study plays the key diagnostic role, demonstrating com- mitment of the blast cell population to the B- or T-cell lineage. The European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias (EGIL) recognised distinct BCP/T-ALL subsets, providing a rational immunological classiﬁcation along with cri- teria for differential diagnosis [8]. Original EGIL standards and deﬁnitions of mixed-lineage leukaemias (MLLs) variously expres- sing B-, T- and myeloid-associated antigens were updated and improved [9, 10]. Further indications on how to best perform diag- nostic ﬂow cytometry were presented by a panel of experts [11]. The early diagnostic step is completed by a rapid molecular screen- ing by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or ﬂuorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) assays pri- marily for the detection of BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangements, de- noting an underlying t(9;22)(q34;q11)/BCR-ABL1 chromosomal translocation typical of Ph+ ALL and sensitive to targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [I, A] [12].

cytogenetics/genetics
Results from cytogenetics, genetics and genomics are available at a later stage, allowing the recognition of several ALL syndromes with prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (reviewed in references [2] and [6]). Standard cytogenetics/FISH and especial- ly RT-PCR are routinely performed to obtain a rapid diagnosis of Ph+ ALL and identify other intermediate/high- and high-risk karyotypes/gene rearrangements, mainly:
 
•	t(4;11)(q21;q23)/MLL-AFA4,	abn11q23/MLL,	t(1;19)(q23;
p13)/PBX-E2A, t(8;14) or other abn14q32 in non-Burkitt ALL,
•	del(6q), del(7p), del(17p), −7, +8, low hypodiploidy, i.e. with 30–39 chromosomes/near triploidy with 60–78 chromo-
somes,
•	complex (≥5 unrelated clonal abnormalities), and
•	T-ALL lacking NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations and/or with
RAS/PTEN abnormalities [I, A] [13–17].

The more prognostically favourable cytogenetic/genetic subsets are t(12;21)( p13;q22)/TEL-AML1 + ALL (rare in adults) and hyperdiploid ALL, and NOTCH-1/FBXW7-mutated T-ALL.


new genetics/genomics
The integration of above studies with new genetics/genomics, i.e. array-comparative genomic hybridisation, gene expression proﬁling, single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis and next-generation sequencing, led to the recognition of highly speciﬁc poor-risk condi-
tions, whose global incidence is ∼30%. These are: Ph-like ALL, characterised by a gene expression proﬁle similar to Ph+ ALL and
associated with IKZF1 deletion, CLRF2 overexpression and tyrosine kinase-activating rearrangements involving ABL1, JAK2, PDGFRB and several other genes [16]; and early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL, characterised by lack of CD1a and CD8, weak CD5 expression, at least one myeloid/stem cell marker, a speciﬁc transcriptional proﬁle and the possible involvement of several critical genes [18]. Other genetic aberrations that impart an inferior outlook are other MLL gene rearrangements, TP53 and CREBBP mutations, and deregula- tion of RAS signalling components (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, NF1). Although these assays are still investigational and not regularly carried out in the clinical practice, they are recommended for new clinical trials to improve the risk classiﬁcation and support targeted therapies [III, B].


other. The diagnostic phase is completed by the search for a sensitive molecular marker or an aberrant leukaemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP) for the detection and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) [III, B] [19]. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing of patients and relatives is recommended at this stage, to facilitate subsequent application of an early stem-cell transplantation (SCT), according to study/treatment indications [V, B].
 
risk assessment and prognostic factors
While the suggested diagnostic work-up permits the identiﬁca- tion of some high-risk (HR) subsets, clinical risk groups are further deﬁned by several disease-related factors and some hos- t-related factors [20, 21], and the individual prognosis is highly reﬁned by ALL response dynamics (Table 2). Patients presenting with no risk factors are deﬁned as standard risk (SR). Older age, reduced tolerability to treatments and higher white blood cell (WBC) count on presentation (reﬂecting higher tumoural burden) are universally recognised as independent risk variables predicting for lower complete remission (CR) rate and shorter CR duration. The kinetics of response to early treatment steps is also well recognised and increasingly sought-for prognostic in- formation. This can be obtained through different methodolo- gies and at different treatment times, ranging from pre-phase therapy ( prednisone response) to induction day 8–15 (marrow blast cell clearance), end of induction (time to CR, MRD) and post-induction phase (MRD) [III, A].

minimal residual disease
Quantiﬁcation of MRD is a major and well-established risk factor and should be obtained whenever possible for all patients also outside of clinical trials. Methods for MRD evaluation and stand- ardisation of MRD quantifıcation have been intensively described [22–24]. Molecular response can be evaluated only for patients in complete cytologic remission (Table 3), with one marker or more for MRD analysis and samples available at the respective time points. Deﬁnition of responses are summarised in Table 3. If MRD is measured by ﬂow cytometry, a good MRD response is
often defıned as less than 10−3, although MRD levels less than 10−4 can be achieved with the 8–12 colour ﬂow cytometers.
Achievement of complete molecular remission (molCR)/ molecular remission is the most relevant independent prognos- tic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. Patients with
molCR after induction therapy in several studies had signiﬁcant- ly superior outcomes, with a DFS of 54%–74%, compared with 17%–40% for MRD-positive patients [25–31]. Patients with molecular failure (molFail) after induction proceeded to allogeneic haematopoietic SCT, and their outcome was thereby substantially improved, compared with the chemotherapy-only arm [29, 32, 33].
The question arises as to whether the evaluation of MRD over- comes all of the pre-therapeutic risk factors, or whether MRD should be combined with the pre-therapeutic factors [27, 34, 35]. A practical approach is to bring the conventional prognostic factors and MRD into a decision algorithm. At diagnosis, patients are stratifıed into SR and HR groups, since HR patients are potential candidates for SCT in ﬁrst complete remission (CR1), and an early donor search is warranted. However, it is not clear how to proceed with HR patients in molCR/molecular remission, although some studies suggest a lack of beneﬁt from SCT in these patients. Also, MRD is not available for all patients, and the risk stratiﬁcation in those patients should rely on conventional risk factors. Overall, a rapid yet comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential for accur- ate risk deﬁnitions and appropriate risk-related treatment choices (Figure 1).

treatment of newly diagnosed ALL
pre-phase therapy and supportive measures
When the diagnosis is established, treatment should start imme- diately, preferably in a specialised hospital; that is, physicians with experience in the treatment of acute leukaemia, a well- trained nursing staff, sufﬁcient supportive care (e.g. platelet sub- stitution) and access to an intensive care unit. A pre-phase therapy with corticosteroids (usually prednisone 20–60 mg/day
 
or dexamethasone 6–16 mg/day, both i.v. or p.o.) alone, or in combination with another drug (e.g. vincristine, cyclophospha- mide), is often given together with allopurinol and hydration for
∼5–7 days. The ﬁrst intra-thecal therapy for central nervous
system (CNS) prophylaxis is administered in this period in some studies. The pre-phase therapy allows a safe tumour re- duction, avoiding in most cases a tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) [35]. In some cases, rasburicase may be given to prevent TLS. In cases with a very high WBC count (e.g. >100 000/µl), either measure is sufﬁcient, and a leukapheresis is needed only in very rare cases. The time needed for pre-phase therapy will also allow to obtain the results of the diagnostic work-up, e.g. cytogenetics, molecular genetics. The response to pre-phase therapy deﬁnes the chemosensitivity of the disease, and is included in some studies for risk assessment, since good responders to prednisone may have a better outcome [36].
Supportive therapy should be initiated whenever necessary early on, e.g. to treat infections or to substitute platelets/erythro- cytes. Severe neutropaenia (<500/µl) is often seen at diagnosis and is most frequent (>80%) during induction therapy, causing infections and infection-related death. A joint analysis of ﬁve randomised trials revealed a shorter duration of neutropaenia, and reduction in the rate of febrile neutropaenia in some but not all cases [37], and based on that, prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor should be considered during induc- tion therapy [II, B].

treatment: remission induction therapy and consolidation
induction of complete remission. The goal of induction therapy is the achievement of a CR, or even better, a molCR/good molecular response, usually evaluated within 6–16 weeks from
start of chemotherapy, after which time the achievement of molCR is rather uncommon. Most regimens are centred on vincristine, corticosteroids, and anthracycline (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, rubidazone, idarubicin), with or without cyclophosphamide or cytarabine. L-Asparaginase is the only ALL-speciﬁc drug that depletes the asparagine levels and has been particularly explored in paediatric trials. It is now more intensively used in adults. Pegylated
 
asparaginase (PEG-Asp) has the advantage of a signiﬁcantly longer period of asparagine depletion. Dexamethasone is often preferred to prednisone, since it penetrates the blood–brain barrier and also acts on resting leukaemic blast cells (LBCs).

results of induction therapy. There are no randomised trials comparing different induction regimens; however, there is a
substantial number of large (>100 patients) prospective non- randomised trials. In 6617 patients from 14 studies, the weighted mean for the CR rate was 83% (62%–92%) [35]. Using current
approaches, the CR rate had increased to 80%–90%, higher for SR patients at ≥90%, and less in HR patients at ∼75%. There is only one randomised study for induction therapy; this compares prednisone to
dexamethasone [38], demonstrating equal outcome [I, C].

treatment principles. There are two chemotherapy regimens; one is a widespread schema patterned after the paediatric BFM (Berlin– Frankfurt–Münster) protocols with Induction I, Induction II, Consolidation cycles, sometimes an intermittent re-induction cycle, and is mostly used in European adult ALL trials. A schematic treatment algorithm in adult ALL, including diagnosis and risk assessment for achievement of CR and risk- oriented post-remission therapy, is given in Figure 1.
Another approach is to repeat two different alternating intensive chemotherapy cycles, identical for Induction and Consolidation, accounting for a total of eight cycles, such as the hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexa- methasone) protocol, preferentially used in the United States, but also in other parts of the world.

post-remission consolidation. The rationale to use systemic high-dose (HD) therapy is particularly to reach sufﬁcient drug levels in sanctuary sites, such as the CNS. Most protocols employ 6–8 courses which contain either HD methotrexate or HD cytarabine ± asparaginase. HD cytarabine is usually administered for 4–12 doses at 1–3 g/m2 and methotrexate at 1–1.5 g/m2 and up to 3 g/m2.

maintenance therapy
Maintenance therapy usually consists of daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate. In some treatment regimens, repeated cycles of vincristine, dexamethasone or other drugs in monthly or longer intervals are given. In one randomised study, the maintenance arm with reinforcement cycles was not superior to conventional maintenance therapy (37% versus 38% at 8 years) [36]. A treatment duration of 2.5–3 years is optimal and is usually recommended.
Omission of maintenance worsens outcome signiﬁcantly in BCP-ALL, but less so in T-ALL [39], and not in B-ALL [40].

CNS prophylaxis
Effective prophylaxis to prevent CNS relapse is an essential part of ALL therapy. Treatment modalities of CNS prophylaxis are CNS irradiation, intra-thecal (i.th.) methotrexate, mono- or i.th. triple (usually methotrexate, steroids, cytarabine) and systemic HD therapy with either methotrexate and/or cytarabine. With a com- bination of these CNS prophylactic measures, the CNS relapse rate in recent adult ALL trials could be reduced from 10% to <5%. CNS irradiation is also effective to eradicate residual LBCs in the CNS; however, in most studies, it is either omitted or restricted to HR patients. Furthermore, it is given only as an irradiation of the skull (mostly 24 Gy), and no longer of the whole neuroaxis, since this aggravates cytopaenias. Patients with CNS involvement (mostly of the leptomeninges) at diagnosis are treated with the standard chemotherapy regimen, and additional i.th. applications
 
until blast clearance in the spinal ﬂuid. Their OS is identical to the CNS-negative cohort of patients, or slightly inferior [41].

age-adapted protocols
The outcome of ALL is strictly related to the age of a patient, with cure rates from 80% to 90% in childhood ALL, decreasing to
<10% in elderly/frail ALL patients. Therefore, age-adapted proto- cols have emerged, where the age limits are mainly directed by the haematological and non-haematological toxicities. Although there is no uniform consensus, the following age groups are separated:
•	Adolescents and young adults (AYA), differently deﬁned from 15/18 to 35/40 years,
•	Adult ALL, age range 35/40 up to ≤55/60 years,
•	Elderly ALL protocols for patients above the age of >55/60
years, and
•	Frail patients not suitable for any intensive therapy, usually considered above the age of 70/75 years.

adolescents and young adults. Paediatric-inspired therapy provides an increased drug intensity at several treatment steps, including larger cumulative doses of drugs such as corticosteroids, vincristine, L-asparaginase and consequent CNS-directed therapy, which should be strictly adhered to, with a reduced role of SCT. In a systemic review and meta-analysis in 2012, in 11 trials including 2489 AYA patients, paediatric-inspired regimens were superior to conventional adult chemotherapy [42]. None of the trials were a randomised comparison. In recent studies for AYAs [43– 45], survival rates at 5 years were 67%–78%, compared with 34%–41% with the former protocols.

adult ALL. The treatment results for adult ALL patients have also improved. In the above-mentioned 14 studies, the weighted mean for DFS was 34% (25% at 5 years, 48% at 3 years) and the
OS 38% (27% at 9 years, 54% at 5 years). Currently, the OS rates for SR adult ALL patients is 50%–70% with chemotherapy alone. The outcome for HR patients has also improved, from 20%–30% to ∼50% when they receive an allogeneic SCT in CR1. Prospective adult studies applying the same drugs and time–dose intensity, using or not using the term ‘paediatric-inspired’, or some using the term ‘paediatric-derived’, achieved identical results compared with AYAs, with survival rates of 60%–70% or more [46–49].

elderly ALL. The incidence of ALL is increasing after the age of 50 years [50]. Different approaches have been applied in this patient cohort [51]. Older patients (55–91 years) with a palliative treatment had a CR rate of 43% (34%–53%), an early death rate of 24% (18%–42%) and an OS of only 7 months (3–10 months). In contrast, those with an intensive chemotherapy designed for adult ALL had a CR rate of 56% (40%–81%), but still an early death rate of 23% (6%–42%), and an OS of 14 months (3–29 months). In recent decades, several elderly speciﬁc ALL protocols have been initiated. Their principle is a less intensive therapy, based on corticosteroids, vincristine and asparaginase, and largely avoiding anthracyclines and alkylating agents, to reduce early treatment-related death. In nine prospective studies for older ALL patients (55–81 years), with this less intensive protocol, the CR rate was 71% (43%–90%), early death decreased to 15% (0%–36%)
and OS was signiﬁcant at 33 months (16–71 months). Thus, all patients, irrespective of age, should be offered a treatment.

targeted therapies
There is still a need to improve the outcome in adult and elderly ALL that is achieved with chemotherapy/SCT alone. Currently, there are two major new approaches, particularly for B-lineage ALL patients; either therapies with antibodies, or, for Ph+ ALL, targeted therapies with TKIs.

antibodies. The anti-CD20 MoAb rituximab has substantially improved the outcome in Burkitt leukaemia/lymphoma, as demonstrated by a single randomised trial [52]. Repeated short cycles of intensive chemotherapy, combined with rituximab increased OS from 62% to 83% (reviewed in [40]). The anti- CD20 antibody is also being applied in CD20-positive de novo B- lineage ALL, with encouraging results [53], and randomised trials are ongoing. The monoclonal antibodies directed against CD22, linked to cytotoxic agents, either to calicheamicin (inotuzumab ozogamicin) or to plant or bacterial toxins (epratuzumab), are explored in refractory/relapsed childhood and adult ALL [54]. Targeting CD19 is of great interest, as it is expressed in all B- lineage cells, most likely including early lymphoid precursor cells. The bispeciﬁc antibody blinatumomab combines single chain antibodies to CD19 and CD3, and thereby T cells lyse the CD19- bearing B cells. It is effective in patients with positive MRD [55] or refractory/relapsed ALL [56]. The CD19 antigen is also the target for a promising new approach, the use of chimaeric antigen receptor-modiﬁed T cells (CART cells) [57, 58].
In T-ALL, speciﬁc antibodies as in B-lineage ALL are not available. The few new drugs under investigation are nelarabine, which is active in advanced disease [59, 60] (currently evaluated in ﬁrst-line therapy), and γ-secretase inhibitors blocking Notch1 signalling.

tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Ph+ ALL. When compared with the pre-imatinib era [61, 62], CR rates improved from 60%–70% to 80%–90% or even higher and short-term outcome was much better in relatively small non-randomised studies, which mostly simply added imatinib to their previous standard chemotherapy regimens   in   Ph+   ALL   patients   [63,   64].   These   marked
improvements were then conﬁrmed in the long term [65–68], with survival reaching ∼50%, compared with ≤20% in the pre- imatinib  era,  making  combined  imatinib/chemotherapy  the
standard treatment of Ph+ ALL. Early enthusiasm was such that even the place of allogeneic SCT in ﬁrst CR (which was considered as the only curative option for Ph+ ALL patients) was challenged. Nevertheless, a recent prospective trial from the GRAALL (Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) suggests that allogeneic SCT is still associated with a better relapse-free survival in younger Ph+ ALL patients [69]. These younger patients may receive standard myeloablative conditioning (MAC), but the role of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)-SCT in older patients remains to be prospectively evaluated. After SCT, a recent randomised study from the GMALL (German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) suggests that prophylactic imatinib maintenance is probably the best option to prevent post-
 
SCT relapse after MAC-SCT [70]. This remains to be studied after RIC-SCT.
Whether a subset of good-risk patients may be treated with continuous TKI/chemotherapy and be proposed allogeneic SCT in ﬁrst CR is still under evaluation, as is the optimal TKI/ chemotherapy combination that could be offered to such patients. Achievement of a good early MRD response (here eval- uated on BCR-ABL1 transcript levels) might be of great help in deﬁning these good-risk patients [71]. In older Ph+ ALL patients, usually not candidates for allogeneic SCT, a poor MRD response but also the presence of additional chromosomal ab- normalities at diagnosis were both associated with a worse outcome [72]. It has also been shown that the presence of IKZF1 gene deletion, a frequent event in Ph+ ALL, may be of poor
prognostic value, as also observed in Ph− ALL patients [73, 74].
The last issue relies on which is the best TKI/chemotherapy front-line combination. Usually, TKI therapy is initiated in front- line therapy together with the ﬁrst chemotherapy cycle. A con- tinuous TKI exposure should be favoured, even if a few weeks off may be needed to limit myelosuppression [75]. To date, there is no comparative study evaluating second-generation TKIs (niloti- nib, dasatinib) versus imatinib as ﬁrst-line treatment. The use of nilotinib and dasatinib may result in achieving a good MRD response more quickly, which could be of interest before SCT. On the other hand, more potent TKIs could induce a higher inci- dence of rate of resistance mutation, as was observed with T315I mutations at relapse in older patients receiving front-line dasati- nib [72]. Combination of TKIs with dose-reduced chemotherapy should probably be preferred, compared with standard intensive chemotherapy/TKI combinations [76]. This has been randomly demonstrated in the GRAAPH-2005 trial, with lower early mor- tality and higher CR rate in patients receiving imatinib, combined with less intensive chemotherapy compared with those receiving Hyper-CVAD/imatinib [69]. GIMEMA (the Italian Group for Haematological Diseases in Adults) has also reported very good response rates and short-term outcomes in older patients treated almost exclusively with front-line dasatinib [77]. Once CR has been reached, autologous SCT might also be a good option, at least in patients who have reached a good MRD response, or in those who cannot tolerate allogeneic SCT [69, 78, 79].
In patients with persistent MRD or progressive disease, the recommendation is to switch to another TKI while screening for TKI resistance mutations and then to adapt TKI choice accord- ing to the resistance proﬁle. The third-generation TKI ponatinib is currently the only option in patients progressing with the T315I mutation.

tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Ph-like ALL. TKIs might be also used as targeted treatment in some patients with Ph− ALL. The
Ph-like entity has recently been described as associated with a gene expression signature similar to Ph+ ALL, but with no Ph chromosome or BCR-ABL1 rearrangement. Kinase-activating events, including ABL1 itself, PDGFR-beta, JAK2 or other kinases are frequently found in this poor-prognosis ALL subset [16], and some remarkable cases of TKI treatment success have been reported in these patients [80, 81]. Imatinib, dasatinib or even ruxolitinib could thus be evaluated in these patients, who frequently have primary refractory ALL or very early relapse. See Table 4.
stem-cell transplantation
Despite the existence of studies and meta-analyses comparing chemotherapy and SCT [82], the issue of the indications of SCT in adult ALL patients in ﬁrst CR is not deﬁned in a satisfactory way and requires continuous update. This is due to the improv- ing results with conventional and targeted chemotherapy regi- mens on one hand and to the decreasing mortality and broader availability of SCT on the other. Several attempts have been made to provide evidence-based guidelines for indication of SCT (Table 5, ref. [83]) [84–86] [V, A]. From these guidelines, the OS for SCT was superior to chemotherapy in HR patients [I, A], but left the role of SCT in SR open [I, C]. On the other hand, there is a general agreement that SCT is clearly the best therapeutic option for patients in second or later CR [III, A].
Some important issues emerged from the results of recent studies:
1)	Whether or not SCT should be offered to AYA with SR factors treated with paediatric-based or -inspired protocols that provide long-term OS rates ∼70% [87]. In view of these results, most groups skip SCT in these patients to avoid acute
mortality and long-term effects [III, B].
2)	The use of MRD (the most important prognostic factor in ALL) to guide the decision of chemotherapy or SCT after consolidation. Data from recent studies have shown that SCT offers better results than chemotherapy in patients with high MRD levels after consolidation, regardless of the convention- al risk factors at baseline [29] [III, A]. The question remains whether SCT is justiﬁed in patients with conventional HR features but low or negative MRD after consolidation, for whom OS rates >50% are expected with chemotherapy [29, 31–33]. Phase III studies addressing this point are desirable, because the trials included in the most recent meta-analysis
[82] did not incorporate the MRD analysis as a decision tool.
3)	The indication for the different types of SCT. Regarding allogen- eic SCT, there is increasing evidence that sibling and very well- matched, unrelated donors (MUD) SCT can be considered equivalent options in terms of results and, therefore, MUD
 
SCT can be offered to patients lacking a sibling donor [IV, A]. Umbilical cord blood can be an alternative source when an HSCT is needed urgently or when the search for a very well-matched, unrelated donor is unsuccessful [88–90]. Haploidentical SCT could be an option in patients without a matched sibling or MUD, but prospective comparative studies are lacking. In turn, autologous SCT is considered inferior to chemotherapy and to allogeneic SCT [91] [I, A], but could be reconsidered in MRD-negative patients [92] unﬁt for allogenic SCT [IV, D], as has been shown in patients with Ph+ ALL [71].
4)	The intensity of the conditioning. There is no standard MAC
regimen, but total body irradiation-based regimens seem to have better anti-leukaemic activity than busulfan-based pre- parative regimens [93] [IV, B]. RIC regimens are increasingly considered as an option for elderly HR patients or patients with contraindications for MAC-SCT [84, 94] [IV, B], but no pro- spective comparative studies between these two types of pre- parative regimens have been conducted in young, ﬁt patients.
5)	The need for SCT in speciﬁc genetically deﬁned groups of
ALL, such as BCR-ABL1-positive (as previously reviewed) or MLL-positive cases. Allogeneic SCT is currently carried out for MLL-rearranged ALL in most trials and, in the largest study conducted to date, better results have been observed compared with chemotherapy [95] [IV, A].

treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL
Relapsed ALL in adults is still a major clinical challenge. There is no universally accepted treatment protocol and a lack of evi- dence based on randomised, controlled trials. However, there is consensus on the general approach to managing these patients.
diagnostic work-up
Therapy-related AML should be excluded. Enumeration of CD19, CD20 and CD22 expression on blast cells is important as it may have therapeutic relevance. Cytogenetic evaluation should take into account fusion proteins that may indicate a BCR-ABL- like phenotype [16, 81]. If allogeneic SCT is a possible therapeutic option, and if this was not done at diagnosis, the HLA proﬁling of the patient and siblings should be carried out urgently, and an
unrelated donor search should be initiated if a sibling match is not available. In the case of Ph+ ALL, BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain mutations should be evaluated [96].
Overall evaluation of the clinical situation should take into account the disease-speciﬁc factors (BCP-ALL or T-ALL, BCR- ABL1 status), patient factors (age, performance status, organ function and presence of extramedullary disease, in particular CNS), previous therapy (with particular reference to prior allo- graft, anthracycline dose) and speciﬁc toxicities of prior treatment which might guide therapeutic selection (e.g. osteonecrosis, vinca alkaloid neuropathy and speciﬁc infectious complications such as fungal infections).

treatment principles
Treatment with a curative aim involves achievement of CR fol- lowed by allogeneic SCT. In four large trials, the outcome was very similar [59, 97–99]. The rate of second CR achieved was 44%–45%, the median OS 4.5–8.4 months (24% at 3 years in one study). Long duration of ﬁrst CR (>2 years), then re-induction with a standard induction regimen—such as that used for original treatment—may be used [59, 97–99]. Short ﬁrst CR or primary refractory disease is a very high-risk situation, and consideration should immediately be given to the availability of trials of novel agents that may be non-cross-resistant with chemotherapy. For BCP-ALL, such agents are now more widely available. Both
blinatumomab [56] and inotuzumab [96] have shown promising results in phase II studies and are being evaluated in randomised, controlled trials where the comparator arm is ‘standard of care’ chemotherapy. A clinical trial involving immunotherapy with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy [58] is also a possibility.

chemotherapy for relapsed ALL. The most commonly used regimens in Europe are ﬂudarabine- and anthracycline-containing regimens, for example, FLAG-Ida (ﬂudarabine, high-dose ara-C,
 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and idarubicin). Despite its common use and inclusion as ‘standard of care’ arm in current randomised, controlled trials of relapsed ALL, there is remarkably little published on FLAG-Ida in relapsed ALL [97]. Clofarabine- based regimens including cytarabine, cyclophosphamide or etoposide are also commonly used based mostly on data in childhood ALL [98]. Liposomal vincristine [99] is licensed for the treatment of relapsed ALL. These standard chemotherapy approaches are applicable in BCP-ALL as well as in T-ALL
Additionally, nelarabine is licensed for this indication, and a response rate of about 50% is noted [59]. Myelotoxicity is mild to moderate, but the neurotoxicity can be severe and irreversible. Co-administration with agents used to treat CNS disease can increase the risk.


Ph+ ALL. Patients with relapsed Ph+ ALL should be offered the new generations of TKIs, according to the results of mutational analysis of their BCR-ABL1 transcripts. Patients who have lost response to imatinib may respond to nilotinib or dasatinib and there is even an option, ponatinib, for patients with the T315I mutation. Although TKIs are not without adverse events (ponatinib, in particular, carries a risk of cardiovascular events), they are nonetheless a vastly superior option compared with repetitive treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy, as they preserve performance status and are better tolerated by elderly patients. There is no evidence of long-term survival induced by TKIs post-relapse and the majority of patients will have to receive allogeneic SCT. Second allografts are being reported, and there are case reports of good outcomes, although of uncertain long-term beneﬁt.
Even in a palliative setting BCR-ABL1, kinase domain muta-
tional analysis should be carried out and used to guide therapy with TKIs and to monitor treatment response and impending relapse.
 
personalised medicine
Progress in the diagnosis of ALL with identiﬁcation of genomic- deﬁned sub-entities, the evaluation of MRD, and new targeted therapies have led to a substantial realisation of personalised medicine in adult ALL. Current options such as less intensive chemotherapy, new modalities of SCT, incorporation of targeted therapies and optimal combinations of treatments require pro- spective, cooperative research, hereby further reﬁning the indivi- dualised approach to each patient.

follow-up and long-term implications
The follow-up of asymptomatic patients should include blood cell counts and routine chemistry during maintenance therapy; usually every 2 weeks during the ﬁrst 2 years to adjust treatment accordingly. Thereafter, follow-up should be 3-monthly in years 1, 2 and 3, since the majority of relapses occur within the ﬁrst
2.5 years after initiation of treatment; then half-yearly in the 4th and 5th year. For evaluation of MRD, which is now the most im- portant prognostic parameter, bone marrow aspiration is required 3-monthly. It is also desirable in Ph+ MRD to search for MRD (BCR-ABL) and, if possible, for mutations to switch to another TKI inhibitor.
In adults, adverse long-term effects are fewer compared with children with ALL, and most adult ALL patients are in good clinical conditions. Relevant late toxicities are: endocrinological disorders (thyroid, gonadal), osteonecrosis/osteoporosis, skin and mucosal disorders, cataract, cardiovascular disorders, infec- tion, graft versus host disease/sicca syndrome, fatigue and cogni- tive disorders. Second malignancies can also occur but with a low frequency (<3%) after chemotherapy as well as SCT. Long- term observation including quality-of-life assessment of cured ALL patients is an essential part of treatment optimisation studies.
