incidence and epidemiology
The yearly incidence of malignant glioma is ∼3–5/100 000 with a slight predominance in males. Malignant glioma may develop at all ages, with the peak incidence being in the ﬁfth and sixth decades of life [1–3]. Exposure to ionising irradiation has been associated with increased risk of development of glioma, while association with the use of cell phones could not be conﬁrmed in epidemiological studies. Rare hereditary syndromes carry an increased risk for glioma: Cowden-, Turcot-, Lynch-, Li- Fraumeni syndrome and neuroﬁbromatosis type 1.

diagnosis and pathology
The commonly used World Health Organization (WHO) clas- siﬁcation distinguishes tumours according to their presumed cell of origin (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes), and  grades them from grade I–IV [4]. Grade I tumours occur mainly in childhood, and grade II (or low-grade) glioma are slow-growing tumours but will almost invariably transform over time to a more malignant phenotype. Grade III tumours (also commonly referred to as anaplastic glioma) comprise anaplastic astrocy- toma, mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma, while glioblastoma (GBM) represents WHO grade IV. Tissue diagnosis is mandatory, and usually obtained by stereotactic biopsy or after tumour resection. GBM carries the worst prognosis, while pure oligodendroglioma has a protracted natural history and better outcome, and excellent response to therapy. Prognosis of mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma is intermediate between GBM and pure anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Concordance between local diag- nosis and central neuropathology review can be as low as 50%, thus careful review of the histology by an expert neuropathology

team is recommended [5, 6]. Molecular markers are useful add- itional tools for diagnosis and treatment guidance (see below), and are of increasing importance in daily practice. Adequate tissue collection and preservation (e.g. sufﬁcient material, fresh frozen tumour tissue) should be planned prospectively (see Table 1).

molecular markers
Genetic loss on chromosomes 1p/19q (co-deletion or loss of heterozygosity [LOH] 1p/19q) is a consequence of a chromo- somal translocation and describes a distinct tumour entity characterised by a prolonged natural history irrespective of treat- ment, and increased sensitivity both to radiotherapy (RT) and to chemotherapy [7]. LOH 1p/19q should be evaluated to support a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma.
Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH) were
recognised in 2008 as an early event in glioma genesis [8]. Mutations in the IDH gene 1 or 2 are hallmarks of low-grade glioma; when observed in high-grade glioma, it suggests that the tumour has developed from a lower grade precursor lesion (sec- ondary GBM) [9, 10]. Less than 10% of individuals with adult
GBM carry an IDH mutation, while ∼60% of grade III tumours
are IDH-mutated [8, 11]; IDH-mutated tumours are associated
with a more favourable prognosis [12, 13]. Indeed, the survival of IDH-mutated GBM is more favourable than for non-mutated grade III astrocytoma, thus underscoring the strong prognostic
value of this ﬁnding [10, 12]. The more frequent IDH1 mutation accounts for ∼90% of all IDH mutations and can be demon- strated by immunohistochemistry, while IDH2 mutations and IDH1 mutations at other sites can only be identiﬁed by sequen-
cing. In lower grade tumours or suspected transformed glioma, IDH sequencing should be carried out if staining by immuno- histochemistry with the anti-IDH antibody (which recognises R132H mutation) is negative.
Epigenetic silencing of the methyl-guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) gene promoter by gene promoter methylation suggests a partial inability of the tumour to repair the chemotherapy- induced DNA damage [14]. In retrospective analyses, MGMT methylation has been correlated with a response to or beneﬁt

limited to the central nervous system and distant metastases are virtually non-existent; thus, staging focuses on imaging of the brain, ideally by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The spine and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) are not routinely assessed in the absence of clinical symptoms. Ideally, the extent of tumour re- section and determination of residual disease should be assessed after surgery; however, this assessment must be carried out within 24–48 h in order to distinguish post-surgical contrast en- hancement from residual tumour. Lower tumour grade, radical tumour resection, younger age (<50 years), good performance status and an intact neurological function are favourable prog- nostic factors. Determination of molecular markers (discussed above) will identify patients with a more favourable prognosis or better chance of response to alkylating agent chemotherapy.

 




of alkylating agent chemotherapy [II, B] [15, 16]. MGMT deter- mination by immunohistochemistry lacks standardisation, reproducibility and, most importantly, correlation with clinical outcome [III, C], while MGMT status determination by methylation-speciﬁc polymerase chain reaction (MSP) has been largely standardised and allows for reproducible results [17, 18]. A predictive value of a methylated MGMT status for response to or beneﬁt from alkylating agent chemotherapy and thus improved outcome has been demonstrated repeatedly in GBM [19, 20]. However, in lower grade IDH-mutated tumours, MGMT methylation identiﬁes a sub-population with a better prognosis irrespective of the applied treatment [18].
The determination of these markers is now part of routine practice; however, whether MGMT methylation status deter- mination is carried out for an individual patient depends on the diagnostic and therapeutic context (Table 2). In the absence of clinical consequences and better alternative treatments, MGMT status assessment may not be necessary for every patient [V, D]; nevertheless, in elderly patients improved outcome with adapted treatment strategy [i.e. temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy for MGMT-methylated tumours, radiotherapy for unmethylated tumours] has been demonstrated in two randomised trials [II, A] [19, 20]. In current clinical trials, MGMT status is always required as a stratiﬁcation factor. For a detailed discussion, the reader is referred to recent extensive reviews [18].
These markers are neither mutually exclusive nor entirely in- dependent. MGMT promoter methylation is highly associated with LOH 1p/19q and IDH mutations [11]. MGMT methylation is predictive for beneﬁt from alkylating agent chemotherapy in GBM, while it confers a largely prognostic value in anaplastic grade III tumours. A recent report from the Neuro-Oncology Working Group (NOA) of the German Cancer Society conﬁrmed a predictive value of MGMT methylation for beneﬁt from chemotherapy in patients with a wild-type IDH, independ- ent of tumour grade [21].

staging and risk assessment
Although glioma are invasive tumours with a strong propensity of glioma cells to migrate, tumour dissemination remains
 
disease management and treatment plan
general management
Patients should be evaluated and the treatment plan determined by a specialised multidisciplinary team including neurosur- geons, medical and radiation oncologists, but also an expert neuropathologist and neuroradiologist. Special consideration should be given to performance status and neurological func- tion. Corticosteroids (usually dexamethasone 8–16 mg/day, but lower doses may be just as effective) allow for rapid reduction of tumour-associated oedema and improve clinical symptoms. Patients’ glucose levels need to be monitored. Steroids are not necessary in patients without increased intracranial pressure or in the absence of oedema-associated neurological deﬁcits. There is no need for prolonged steroid therapy after tumour resection or for prophylaxis during radiotherapy in asymptomatic patients. Rapid tapering and discontinuation of corticosteroids is recom- mended in order to avoid toxicity associated with prolonged ex- posure to steroids, e.g. myopathy and weakness, lymphopenia and risk of infection, osteoporosis and Cushing syndrome.
Anti-epileptic therapy is indicated in patients presenting with seizures; however, prophylactic use of anticonvulsants outside the perioperative phase is not indicated [III, C]. After tumour resection, the indication for anti-seizure therapy should be revis- ited only if seizures occur [22, 23]. First generation anti-epileptic drugs ( phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and their deri- vatives) are strong inducers of the hepatic metabolism, and may interfere with medications including many commonly used chemotherapy agents (but not with TMZ). Agents such as lamo- trigine, levetiracetam, pregabalin or valproic acid are preferred.
Glioma patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic events due to a tumour-induced hyper-coagulable state, but also as a consequence of neurological deﬁcits, immobilisation and steroid use [24]. Prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended; however, a low threshold for excluding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli is indicated when suspicious symptoms occur. The presence of a brain tumour is not a contraindication for the use of standard anticoagulants in patients with proven thrombosis.

resection is of prognostic value; it may be beneﬁcial to attempt maximal tumour resection provided that neurological function is not compromised by the extent of resection [II, C] [25]. An in- crease in the complete resection rate and improvement in progres- sion-free survival (PFS) have been shown when surgery is carried out under blue light with the use of ﬂuorescent marking of the tumour by 5-amino-laevulinic acid (5-ALA) [26]. When micro- surgical resection is not safely feasible (e.g. due to location of the tumour or impaired clinical condition of the patient), a biopsy should be carried out. In experienced hands, the diagnostic yield is >95% [18]. A sufﬁcient amount of tissue should be obtained for molecular analyses, and open biopsies may yield more tissue to allow this compared with stereotactic biopsies. On freshly frozen specimens, molecular genetic analyses (LOH 1p/19q, MGMT pro- moter methylation) can be carried out even with small amounts of tissue, and this should be planned beforehand [27].
Implantation of chemotherapy-impregnated wafers (carmus- tine polymers) into the resection cavity before radiotherapy has been shown to marginally improve median survival compared with radiotherapy alone [II, B] [28]; however, no prospective data are available when compared with current standard TMZ/ RT (see below) [29]. An increase in wound healing and infec- tious complications has been reported. The combination of car- mustine wafers and TMZ/RT has not been assessed in prospective trials, a retrospective comparison failed to demon- strate additive efﬁcacy [IV, D] [30].
 
Fractionated localised radiotherapy (60 Gy, 30–33 fractions of 1.8–2 Gy, or equivalent doses/fractionations) is part of the stand- ard treatment after resection or biopsy [I, A] [31]. Escalating doses beyond 60 Gy have not been shown to be of value. In elderly patients or patients with a low performance status, shorter hypo-fractionated regimens (e.g. 40 Gy in 15 fractions) are com- monly proposed [II, B] [32]. Radiotherapy (28 × 1.8 Gy, 50 Gy) in patients >70 years of age was superior to best supportive care alone in a randomised phase III trial [II, B] [33]. Exclusive TMZ chemotherapy has shown an improved outcome compared with radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with a methylated MGMT gene promoter in two randomised trials [II, A] [19, 20] (see Figure 1).

glioblastoma (WHO grade IV)
Concomitant and adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy (TMZ/RT → TMZ) signiﬁcantly improved median, 2- and 5-year survival in a large randomised trial, and is the current standard of care for patients with GBM up to age 70 [34, 35] [I, A], or ﬁt elderly patients older than 70 years [II, B] [36]. TMZ is administered daily (7 days a week) during radio- therapy and for 5 days every 4 weeks for six cycles as maintenance (adjuvant) treatment after the end of radiation. MGMT gene promoter methylation has been demonstrated as the strongest prognostic marker for outcome, and the added beneﬁt of TMZ

chemotherapy appears largely restricted to this subgroup [16]. Feasibility of upfront testing and stratiﬁcation by MGMT status has been demonstrated in large prospective trials, and alternative strategies for patients with unmethylated MGMT are proposed to patients as part of ongoing clinical trials. In the absence of effect- ive better alternatives, TMZ/RT → TMZ remains the standard of care for the majority of GBM patients [II, B].
Owing to the overall inferior prognosis of elderly patients, shorter, simpler and less intensive treatment strategies have been investigated in frail or elderly patients approximately >65 years of age. Although hypo-fractionated RT (10 × 3.4 or 15 × 2.66 Gy) has been shown equivalent to standard fractionated irradiation with 30 fractions (60 Gy) in one trial [II, A] [32], the 6-week regimen was inferior compared with hypo-fractionated RT in patients >70 years in a subsequent larger randomised trial [19, 32], supporting the practice of administering RT as a short hypo- fractionated course in elderly patients. Primary chemotherapy versus radiotherapy has been compared in two randomised phase III trials reported in 2012 [19, 20]. Consistently, both trials have demonstrated a poor median overall survival (OS) of 7–9 months. MGMT promoter methylation was strongly predictive for a beneﬁt from TMZ chemotherapy, suggesting that patients with a methylated MGMT are better treated with chemotherapy, while patients with an unmethylated MGMT should be managed with radiotherapy alone [II, A] [19, 20]. In the absence of informa- tion on the MGMT status, the appropriate treatment is hypo- fractionated radiotherapy [II, A] [33]. A randomised, controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT#00482677) investigating hypo- fractionated RT ± concomitant and maintenance TMZ completed recruitment in 2013; ﬁrst results are expected in late 2014.
Recent large phase III trials of novel treatment approaches failed to improve survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Dose intensiﬁcation of the adjuvant or maintenance TMZ therapy [36], the addition of cilengitide [37] or the add- ition of bevacizumab [38, 39] did not translate into prolongation of OS. The clinical value of the observed prolonged PFS with
bevacizumab remains controversial. The reported median OS from surgery in these clinical trials is ∼16–18 months for both the control and experimental arms, and no substantial improve-
ment over the results of the initial European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/National Cancer Institute of Canada TMZ trial [median 15 months, 95% conﬁ- dence interval (CI) 13–17 months] was demonstrated.

anaplastic astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma and oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III)
Anaplastic astrocytoma and oligoastrocytoma have a better prog- nosis compared with glioblastoma. Standard therapy consists of adjuvant radiotherapy up to 60 Gy after surgery. The value of con- comitant and/or maintenance chemotherapy with TMZ has not been tested prospectively [V, D]. Long-term follow-up (10 years) of randomised clinical trials demonstrated prolonged survival with (neo)adjuvant PCV chemotherapy (procarbazine, lomustine [CCNU], vincristine) in newly diagnosed anaplastic oligoastrocy- toma and oligodendroglioma [40, 41], but beneﬁt was mainly present in prognostically favourable molecular subgroups of patients (in particular co-deletion of 1p/19q) [II, B]. In a more recent randomised trial with follow-up data currently available up
 
to 4.5 years, time to failure of both chemotherapy and radiation was similar whether patients were treated initially with chemo- therapy (and received RT at ﬁrst progression) or were treated with initial RT (and received chemotherapy at progression) [I, A] [42]. An updated report is awaited. No difference of efﬁcacy was appar- ent between PCV or TMZ chemotherapy [II, B].

diffuse glioma (WHO grade II)
Diffuse gliomas are low-grade tumours and comprise the histo- logical subtypes of astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma and oligo- dendroglioma. Although they have a protracted natural history of years or occasionally decades, and may not need immediate therapy, these tumours invariably recur and often transform into a higher histological grade.
The diagnosis is often made after an initial seizure is observed as a presenting symptom, or when imaging of the brain is carried out to investigate neurological deﬁcits, changes in mood or personality. At that time, the tumour may already have grown to a substantial size without causing evident neurological dys- function, due to its slow growth over many years.
Radical surgery both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is the backbone of low-grade glioma management. It is assumed that, by resection of all visible tumour tissue, the risk of subse- quent malignant transformation is substantially reduced [III, B]. In an exemplary randomised trial, investigators from the EORTC have demonstrated that an ‘expectative’ or cautious ap- proach—delaying additional radiotherapy until symptoms prevail and the tumour has grown to >5–6 cm—will substantially delay or eliminate the need for irradiation in a signiﬁcant number of patients [I, A] [43]. Adjuvant radiotherapy for a total dose of
50.4 Gy (28 × 1.8 Gy) is the accepted standard of care [I, A]. Two randomised trials investigated lower (45–50.4 Gy) versus higher dose (59.4–64.8 Gy) of irradiation; the lower dose was equivalent to the higher dose with less toxicity [44, 45]. Based on these trials, a number of negative prognostic factors were identiﬁed: tumour size >5–6 cm, tumours crossing the mid-line, absence of oligo- dendroglial histology, age >40 years and neurological deﬁcits before surgery [46]. Three or more of these risk factors are con- sidered an indication for adjuvant radiotherapy. A contemporary randomised trial compared adjuvant single-agent TMZ chemother- apy (without radiation) with standard radiotherapy. Preliminary results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in 2013, and demonstrated that PFS analysis favours radio- therapy; however, follow-up is too early for ﬁrm conclusions and survival results are not yet mature [47]. Molecular characterisation of tumours may allow identiﬁcation of subgroups of patients beneﬁ- tting from one of the other treatment modalities, with 1p/19q co- deleted tumours having a similar PFS after TMZ chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has conducted a randomised trial in a similar population exploring the efﬁcacy of adjuvant PCV chemotherapy after radiotherapy. At the time of ﬁrst presentation, the follow-up data were immature; thus, deﬁnitive conclusions are not yet possible [48].

recurrent disease
Some beneﬁt of chemotherapy has been shown for patients with an adequate performance status who have not received prior
 
adjuvant cytotoxic therapy. Relapsing low-grade astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas are more likely than GBM to respond to TMZ chemotherapy [III, B] [49, 50]. For patients progressing after prior chemotherapy, there is no estab- lished chemotherapy regimen available and patients are best treated within investigational clinical protocols. Chemotherapy with PCV or single-agent nitrosourea therapy may achieve similar tumour control rates compared with TMZ [51–53]. Randomised trials in recurrent glioblastoma have failed to demonstrate measur- able anti-tumour efﬁcacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition by erlotinib or platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibition by imatinib in an unselected patient popula- tion [II, C] [54, 55]. High response rates and a steroid-sparing effect have been observed with the administration of bevacizumab (± irinotecan); however, the effect is frequently short-lived and may be due exclusively to changes in vascular permeability; the effect on life expectancy remains unknown [III, C] [56, 57]. Randomised trials evaluating the pan-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor cediranib or protein kinase C inhibitor enzastaurin failed to demonstrate improved outcome, and provide contemporary data on the limited but conﬁrmed single-agent efﬁcacy of lomustine (CCNU) [52, 53]. Applying alternating electric ﬁelds—tumour-treating ﬁelds (TTFs)—using a battery- powered device connected to electrodes placed on the patient’s scalp—was compared with physicians’ choice of chemotherapy in a randomised trial in recurrent disease [58]. TTF failed to prolong survival compared with second-line chemotherapy [I, A].
There may be an indication for a re-operation [IV, C], in par- ticular in patients where the recurrent tumour exerts an acute mass effect. However, there are no prospective data available on the impact of repeat surgery on OS. Retrospective analyses on selected patients did not identify surgery for recurrent disease as a signiﬁcant prognostic factor for prolonged survival [59, 60]. Repeat surgery and implantation of carmustine-impregnated polymers may lead to marginal prolongation of survival com- pared with placebo, as demonstrated in a randomised trial conducted in the early 1990s [II, B] [61].
Re-irradiation is being considered increasingly for recurrent small tumours [IV, C], although there is considerable doubt about its beneﬁt and the literature lacks prospective and com- parative trials [62, 63]. The few limited size case series do not allow for any conclusion.

response evaluation
MRI is the preferred imaging method. Increased contrast en- hancement and presumed tumour progression on imaging 4–12 weeks after the end of radiotherapy may be due to a reactive process following radiotherapy ( pseudo-progression) [64, 65]. Early presumed progression after the end of radiotherapy should raise the possibility of pseudo-progression, and chemo- therapy should be continued as planned with repeat imaging after 6–8 weeks. An incidence of >60% pseudo-progression has been reported among patients with early radiological progres- sion after radiochemotherapy [66].
Response to chemotherapy is currently evaluated according to the 2D Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) cri- teria, in which in addition to contrast enhancement, tumour ex- tension on T2- and ﬂuid-attenuated inversion recovery
 
(FLAIR)-weighted MRI are evaluated [67]. Furthermore, an as- sessment of neurological function and corticosteroid use is included. The recent introduction of anti-angiogenic and vascu- lar modifying agents led to a reassessment of response criteria, in which, in addition to contrast enhancement, tumour exten- sion on T2- and FLAIR-weighted MRI are to be evaluated [67]. In cases of doubtful differential diagnosis between tumour re- currence and treatment-induced unspeciﬁc changes (especially after multimodal therapy), magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron-emission tomography investigation using an amino acid tracer (e.g. methionine, ﬂuoro-ethyl-tyrosine) may be helpful [III, B] [68]. However, often both residual tumour and necrotic and inﬂammatory changes are present in the same lesion.

personalised medicine
Recent investigation of molecular markers, gene expression, whole genome sequencing and epigenetics has enabled identiﬁ- cation of patient subgroups according to pathway activation, speciﬁc aberrations or pathognomonic molecular characteristics [69]. The clinical utility of IDH mutations, LOH 1p/19q and MGMT promoter methylation in prognostication and their predictive value and role in clinical decision-making have been discussed in the relevant subheadings above. ATRX mutations have been identiﬁed to be speciﬁc for astrocytic lineage. Other markers like EGFR overexpression and EGFR variant III (EGFRviii) mutation are characteristic for GBM that carry an in- ferior prognosis (reviewed in [70]). Targeting the EGFR with speciﬁc inhibitors and vaccination against EGFRviii are current- ly under clinical investigation [71]. Rare activating BRAF muta- tions can be identiﬁed in 3%–5% of GBM; whether the BRAF inhibitors are effective (alone or in combination) in this sub- group of tumours is subject of ongoing clinical research proto- cols. All planned investigational protocols are being designed for speciﬁc subgroups, selecting and enriching for speciﬁc molecular aberrations when targeting activated pathways.

follow-up and long-term implications
Follow-up consists of a clinical evaluation with particular atten- tion to neurological function, seizures and corticosteroid use. Patients should be tapered off steroid use as early as possible. Venous thrombotic events occur frequently in patients with residual or recurrent tumours. Laboratory tests are not indicated unless the patient is receiving chemotherapy (blood counts), corticosteroids (glucose) or anti-epileptic drugs (blood count, liver function tests). MRI every 3–4 months is standard practice outside clinical trials, unless more frequent monitoring is clinic- ally indicated.
