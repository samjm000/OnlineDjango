INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
The latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification from 2015 has grouped lung and thymic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) (named neoplasm in the digestive WHO classification) within one unique group but confirmed their subdivision into four main categories: typical carcinoid (TC), atypical carcinoid (AC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).1 These guidelines are restricted to lung carcinoid (LC) and thymic carcinoid (ThC). Patients with carcinoids are generally younger, have a better prognosis and do not have a strong association with smoking, as compared with SCLC and LCNEC.1 The incidence of LC is very low, ranging from 0.2-2/
100 000 persons/year in both the United States and Europe.2,3 Numbers are increasing, likely due to increased awareness and improved diagnostic techniques, although it may also be a genuine overall increase in incidence.2,3 LCs account for 20%-25% of all NETs and 1%-2% of all lung cancers. LCs prevail slightly more often in women than in

men. LCs occur during the fifth or sixth decade of life for TC and a decade later for AC.4-10
ThC is an extremely rare tumour accounting for an age- adjusted rate of 0.02/100 000-0.18/100 000/year in the European or USA populations, respectively.3,11 In the Netherlands cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemi- ology and End Results (SEER) programme database, <0.5% of all neuroendocrine neoplasms were ThC, representing 5% of thymic tumours.3,11 The incidence of ThC is increasing in the USA population.11 ThC prevails in men and the mean age at diagnosis is 55 years.1,11-13
LC and ThC may also be present in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome or when there is a family history of carcinoid tumours or diffuse pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc. 2021.01.003).1,14-17
Recommendation
The scarcity of LCs and ThCs justifies the therapeutic management of these patients by expert multidisci- plinary teams in centres grouped within networks (na- tional or European networks) for care and research optimisation [V, A].
DIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
LC is revealed by non-specific tumour-related respiratory symptoms (mainly, central forms) or incidentally (mainly,
 

 
peripheral forms). A minority of cases present with symp- toms related to hormonal hypersecretion, including carci- noid syndrome (CS), due to serotonin and other compound secretions, Cushing’s syndrome (CuS), due to adrenocorti- cotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and acromegaly, due to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secre- tion.5,7,18,19 In a recent large population-based study series of 3002 LC patients, CS was present in 229 patients (7.6%) at diagnosis.20
Diagnosis is carried out with bronchoscopic technique, transthoracic biopsy or, less frequently, by mediastinoscopy or endobronchial endoscopic ultrasonography (EBUS) (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).
Surgery may be carried out upfront after adequate medical preparation in localised resectable tumours resembling LCs or in tumours considered at high risk of bleeding or hormonal crisis or when previous biopsy has failed. Once the diagnosis is suspected, standardised char- acterisation of LC comprises several specific steps for eval- uation that are described in Table 1 [III, B].4-9,18,20-34
ThC is revealed by tumour-related symptoms, or due to functionally active tumours or by chance.11-13 Diagnostic procedures, including core biopsy under ultrasonography guidance, or preferably through a thoracic computed tomog- raphy (CT) scan, or upfront surgery following the guidelines for thymic tumour diagnosis, should be carried out.35 The authors recommend standardised characterisation of ThC in multidis- ciplinary expert centres as described in Table 1 [III, B].11,12,32-37 The histopathological diagnosis of LC or ThC relies on characteristic morphological features and on the demon- stration of the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour through the immunodetection of a panel of markers including at least chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin, which are usually expressed in all carcinoids. This might be expanded to other markers such as CD56.1 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) may be useful in well-differentiated tumours only, when positive, to suggest the lung origin of metastatic tumours.1 TCs and ACs are distinguished (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003), on the basis of mitotic count and presence or absence of necrosis.1 While Ki-67 index is not included in the WHO criteria, the WHO acknowledges that Ki-67 index might be useful for the differential diagnosis between well- or poorly- differentiated NETs (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).1 Carcinoids are characterised by mutations involving either MEN-1 or other genes encoding chromatin-remodelling proteins.38,39 TP53 and particularly RB1 gene alterations, which are rare molecular events in carcinoids, might be potential tools to discriminate between well or poorly differentiated categories in difficult cases like the recently identified LC with high proliferative features. This new subgroup is defined by a
mitotic count >10 and/or a Ki-67 index >20%, and a well- differentiated morphology (Supplementary Table S2, avail-
able at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).39-43 The ratio between TC and AC is about 6 : 10 in surgical se- ries but may be closer to 1 : 1 in advanced cases.1,4,6,7,20

The ThC WHO classification is identical to that of lung NETs with four categories including TC or AC defined using the same criteria (Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003). The pattern of genetic alterations is different from LC.1,38 As for LCs, a subgroup of ThC with high proliferative features has recently been recognised.44 The ratio between atypical and typical ThC is about 2 : 1.1,33,34,36

Recommendations
Management of LC and ThC requires a multidisciplinary standardised approach in specialised centres [IV, A]
Ki-67 (MIB 1) [IV, A], TTF1 [IV, B], p53/RB1 [IV, B]
biomarker analyses are recommended in selected cases for differential diagnosis or site of origin orientation.

STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk assessments depend on pathology and TNM (tumoure nodeemetastasis) staging based on the combination of
 

 
intravenous (i.v.) contrast-enhanced cross-sectional con- ventional (radiological) imaging, including liver late arterial phase and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT with gallium-68 (68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues (SSAs) functional imaging as described in Table 1 and Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003 [II, B].23-30,37,45
Serum CgA is measured in all patients, whereas specific biomarkers [5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), ACTH, urinary-free cortisol (UFC), GHRH, insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF-1)] are assessed depending on the presence of functioning syndromes. Insufficient accuracy of CgA (30%- 60% at the metastatic stage) makes research on new biomarkers critical. Among these, a multianalyte molecular assay [51 transcripts; neuroendocrine tumor test (NETest)] is currently under development with potentially better sensitivity, but uncertainties remain regarding its positive predictive value and role as a prognostic marker for LC.22
The application of the 8th Edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) is recommended even if not specific to LCs.31,46,47 More than 80% of LCs are diagnosed at TNM stage I or II.4,5-7,46 The most common sites of metastasis include liver, bone and lung. The diversity of metastatic sites and the potential overestimation of lung metastasis and underestimation of brain metastasis must be taken into account.46,47 The WHO classification and patho- logical TNM (pTNM) staging are intricate.5,21,48 In a recent study in which patients underwent 10 lymph node resection, frequency of positive lymph nodes was 17% (including 6% N2-N3) or 46% (including 23% N2-N3) in case of TC or AC, respectively.48
Most ThCs are diagnosed at advanced-stage Masaokae Koga (Supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) or TNM stage III or IV.11,12,32 The most common sites for metastases include the pleura, pericardium, bone, lung and liver.
In LCs, overall survival (OS) is mainly inﬂuenced by WHO pathology and the pTNM classifications.1,5,21,45-49 In stage I, II, III or IV LC patients, 10-year disease-specific survival is 96%, 85%, 81%, 59% and 88%, 75%, 47%, 18%, in TC or AC,
respectively, showing the major prognostic inﬂuence of the WHO classification.46
After resection, WHO classification and pathological lymph node staging (pN) status constitute the two main prognostic parameters (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).4,5,9,21,45,48-51 Although Ki-67 index is considered a promising prognostic marker by the whole author panel, its technique of evaluation and the most accurate thresholds remain a matter of debate; more- over, no definitive validation of its added value to WHO and pTNM classifications has been provided so far in large series of LCs.18,28,45,52,53 At the metastatic stage, WHO classification, performance status, CgA levels, tumour burden and so- matostatin receptor imaging (SRI) uptake, as well as tumour growth slope and the functioning syndrome, should be taken into account for adequate risk assessment [IV, B].47 Prolonged
 
survival of the majority of patients with LCs (including a 60% 5-year OS for metastatic LC) makes adjusted toxicity profile of therapeutic interventions critical [V, A].47
The prognosis of patients with thymic NETs remains poor: in retrospective series, 5- or 10-year OS was 28%-72% or 26%-60%, respectively.11-14,33 Based on a few large, retro- spective thymic NETs series, OS is inﬂuenced by stage, mainly tumour size and completeness of resection (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).11-13,32,33,36 No specific staging system has yet been validated for ThC. The authors there- fore recommend the use of both staging systems (TNM, MasaokaeKoga) together with the WHO classification and resection status for adequate prognostic stratification.1

Recommendations
WHO and pTNM classifications constitute the basis of the prognostic classification [II, B]
i.v. contrast-enhanced cross-sectional conventional imag- ing including liver late arterial phase and PET-CT with 68Ga-labelled SSAs constitute the basis of TNM evalua- tion [II, B]
Specific prognostic factors including tumour growth rate or presence of functioning syndromes are taken into ac- count in advanced-stage LCs and ThCs [IV, B]
Prolonged survival of most patients with LCs makes adjusted toxicity profile of therapeutic interventions crit- ical [V, A].

MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE, LOCAL RECURRENCE AND ADJUVANT THERAPY
Local/locoregional disease treatment
Control of a functioning syndrome must be considered before any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]. Surgery represents the treatment of choice for LCs (both TCs and ACs), even in the case of N2 lymph nodal metastases [IV, A].54 The surgical approach depends on tumour size, loca- tion and preoperative biopsy specimen assessment. The choice of open surgery or minimally invasive approaches will depend on the experience of the surgeon. Patients with small peripheral nodules may be candidates for minimally invasive access including lung resection and lymph node dissection (usually a video-assisted lobectomy/segmentec- tomy). The surgical access for centrally located tumours, those with suspected/proven metastatic lymph nodes, usually requires thoracotomy, depending on the surgeon’s expertise.
Anatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy, lobectomy, bilobectomy, pneumonectomy) and lymph node resection (with a minimum of six nodal stations: three hilar and three mediastinaldalso including subcarinal stationdas recommended by the European Society of Thoracic Surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer) is the preferred extent of resection [IV, B]. Indeed, wedge resec- tion may increase the risk of tumour recurrences, especially in N-positive TC or intermediate-grade ACs.4,5,55,56 In ACs,
 

 
but also in N-positive TCs, lobectomy is reported as superior to segmentectomy in terms of OS in some, but not all.5,7,8,18,51,54,55,57,58 Bronchoplastic procedures (e.g. sleeve resections) are preferred for suitable centrally located tu- mours, with the aim of avoiding pneumonectomy [IV B]. Transfer of patients to specialist centres for sleeve resection should be discussed [IV, B]. Frozen sections of bronchial and vascular margins are recommended to rule out tumour involvement of resection margins, a condition that conse- quently imposes a greater pulmonary resection. Systematic lymph node dissection is recommended as lymph node metastases may be observed in up to 27% of TCs and in up to 47% of ACs, and lymph node resection inﬂuences the prognosis and the modality of follow-up5,45,48,49,56 [IV, B].
R0 resection is achieved in >85% of cases.7,10
In case of distal lung parenchyma destruction, there is an
option for endobronchial resection to relieve the obstruc- tion, followed by reassessment and definitive surgery a few weeks later.
Watchful radiological follow-up, as an alternative to surgery, may be considered in case of cT1N0 carcinoid within the setting of DIPNECH, but also in MEN-1 patients and patients with comorbid conditions, due to the indo- lent course of most tumours [IV, C]. Rarely, carcinoids within the setting of DIPNECH may progress and be considered for sublobar resection (including wedge resection), especially in case of large tumour size and/or presence of lymph nodes and/or uncontrolled functioning syndrome, as a potential alternative to anatomical surgery in these patients to preserve lung function; medical op- tions (SSAs) or nonsurgical locoregional therapeutic pro- cedures may also constitute potential alternatives to be discussed case by case [V, C].14,17,24 Patients with non- DIPNECH or non-MEN-1 multifocal LC primaries may constitute a distinct entity which may benefit from a similar management [V, C].59
Upfront surgery can be offered for all ThCs deemed radically resectable [IV, B]. Resectability judgement is mostly based on the surgeon’s expertise in thymic surgery. Prospective registration of these cases is recommended. Median sternotomy is the standard surgical approach and less invasive forms of access (video-assisted, robotic- assisted) are currently being investigated; in selected cases (tumours invasive to the lung, great vessels or with pleural/pericardial implants), a combined approach (ster- notomy plus anterior thoracotomy) or a thoracotomy are required to achieve a complete tumour resection. Palliative surgery is not recommended. Lymphadenectomy has his- torically rarely been carried out at the time of resection of thymic tumours; however, the latest UICC TNM staging system recommends that locoregional lymph nodal dissec- tion should be carried out also during ThC resection.60 Due to the poor prognosis of ThC, prophylactic thymectomy could be discussed in young male adult patients with MEN-
1 at the time of initial or recurrent parathyroidectomy, especially in families with aggressive thymic tumours [V, C];14,15,61    the    best    surgical    approach    may    include
 
cervicotomy and upper sternal split or other surgical pro- cedures to avoid incomplete thymic resection.

Local recurrence therapy
After a median follow-up of 54-121 months, recurrences occur in up to 7% of TCs and up to 35% of ACs.4,7,18,53,54 One-third are local recurrences.
In case of local recurrence, surgical resection with radical intent is recommended when technically feasible. In patients with significant comorbidity or high operative risk, palliative locoregional procedures or watchful follow-up may constitute an alternative (Supplementary Material, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).54,62

Adjuvant therapy
Large retrospective studies have reported no benefit of adjuvant therapy in both TCs and ACs.5,8-10,18 Therefore, the authors do not recommend routine adjuvant therapy in LCs, [IV, D] for TC; [IV, C] for AC (Figure 1). However, it may be considered in selected fit patients with particularly high risk of relapse (i.e. AC N2) after multidisciplinary discussion [IV, C]. We recommend prospective registration of these cases. Medical options, mainly cytotoxic chemotherapy (ChT) [plus or minus radiotherapy (RT)], cited in these guidelines, should be considered first.
Available literature suggests no benefit from adjuvant therapy in ThCs [V, C].11-13,32 The majority of the author panel suggests individually discussing postoperative thera- pies, including RT and/or systemic therapies (with options discussed in these guidelines), with patients with advanced- stage R0 or R1-2 resection [V, C] (Figure 2).

Recommendations
Control of a functioning syndrome must be considered before any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]
An anatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy, lobectomy, bilobectomy) or bronchoplastic procedures (e.g. sleeve resections) together with lymph node dissec- tion are recommended in localised LCs [IV, B]
Patients with cT1N0 LC within the setting of DIPNECH or MEN-1 syndromes, or with comorbid conditions, may benefit from an initial radiological follow-up without treatment to determine the growth rate. In these subgroups of patients, watchful follow-up or, in case of clinical (functioning syndrome) and or morphological progression, sublobar surgical resections including wedge resection, but also nonsurgical locoregional ther- apeutic procedures or medical treatments (SSAs) to pre- serve lung function constitute alternatives to anatomic pulmonary resection [V, C]
Patients with non-DIPNECH or non-MEN-1 multifocal LC primaries may constitute a distinct entity which may benefit from a similar management [V, C] Pneumonectomy should be avoided where possible and this could include the referral of patients to specialist centres for sleeve resection [IV, B]

No routine adjuvant therapy is recommended in LCs [IV, C for AC; IV, D for TC]. However, cytotoxic ChT (dacarba- zine/temozolomide- or oxaliplatin-based ChT) RT may be considered in selected fit patients with a particularly high risk of relapse (i.e. AC N2) after multidisciplinary dis- cussion [IV, C]
Thymectomy by median sternotomy and/or thoracotomy and lymph node dissection for ThCs is recommended [IV, B] Prophylactic thymectomy could be discussed in young male adult patients with MEN-1 in families with aggres- sive thymic tumours [V, C]
Case-by-case discussion is recommended for additional local and or systemic options in ThCs with R0 (if stage 3 or 4) or R1 or R2 resection [V, C].
 
MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE

Control of tumour growth and functioning syndromes are the goals of the therapeutic management, with the aims of improving both the quality of life (QoL) and survival. The best strategy including sequencing is unknown due to the low number of dedicated trials and absence of predictors of response in NETs. Such information should be shared with the patient. Prognosis, but not predictive factors, guides the decision-making therapeutic management in non- functioning patients [V, A]. Watchful follow-up may be considered in asymptomatic patients with TC and/or slowly radiologically progressing LCs [V, C]. Dedicated LC and ThC trials are urgently needed and should be prioritised.

Recommendations
Prognosis guides the decision-making therapeutic man- agement [V, A]
Watchful follow-up may be considered in asymptomatic patients with slowly radiologically progressing LCs [V, C] Dedicated LC and ThC trials are urgently needed and should be prioritised.

Hormone-related symptom management
Hormone-related symptoms are caused by autonomous secretion of biogenic amines or peptide hormones and are responsible for both QoL and survival alterations. The most frequent functioning syndrome is CS in LC, which requires annual echocardiography screening for carcinoid heart dis- ease, when present or in case of increased 5-HIAA levels [V, C].60 In addition, prospective studies are expected to deter- mine the added value of N-terminal pro hormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the detection of carcinoid
 
heart disease. In contrast, CS is rare in ThC. Based on approval and recommendations in gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NET patients with CS, we recommend long-acting SSAs as first-line symptomatic treatment of CS [V, B].61,63-65 SSAs are also an option in DIPNECH patients presenting with res- piratory symptoms.65 Among second-line options described in Figure 3 and Supplementary Material, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003,64-71 only telotristat ethyl has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of the diarrhoea of refractory CS. CuS caused by ectopic ACTH secretion is the most frequent functional syndrome in ThC. The treatment of choice for CuS by ectopic secretion of ACTH includes steroid synthesis inhibitors such as metyrapone and/or ketoconazole [IV, B]. Options in case of refractory CuS are discussed in Figure 3 and Supplementary Material, available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003.72 Other functional syn- dromes, such as acromegaly or hypercalcaemia, related to
 

 
parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide secretion, are rare and should be treated with SSAs [V, B].64

Recommendations
Annual echocardiography screening in case of CS or increased 5-HIAA levels is recommended [V, C]
SSAs are recommended as first-line therapy for CS [V, B] Short-acting SSAs given intravenously are recommended in perioperative treatment [IV, A]
In patients with refractory CS, a variety of options exist but there is no consensus on the best strategy, due to the lack of specific LC studies
Metyrapone and/or ketoconazole are recommended as
first-line therapy for CuS [IV, B]
In patients with refractory CuS, early bilateral adrenalec- tomy should be considered [IV, B]
SSAs are recommended for other functional syndromes such as acromegaly or hypercalcaemia [V, B].


Anti-tumour management
Locoregional therapy including surgery. Palliative surgery or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation or endo- bronchial treatment (EBT) of the primary tumour are oc- casionally considered in cases of advanced disease at risk of local events or refractory CS [V, B]. More frequently, liver, bone and lung metastases represent potential targets for such strategies with the triple objectives of reducing the locoregional risks, the primary tumour and the secretory burden (Figures 3 and 4). Such multiple locoregional man- agement may represent the only anti-tumour strategy in patients with slowly progressive tumours (Figure 4 and Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) [V, B].67,68,73-75

Recommendations
Palliative surgery or locoregional procedures (RFA, cryoa- blation, EBT) of the primary tumour are occasionally considered in cases of advanced disease at risk of local events or refractory CS [V, B]
Multiple locoregional therapies including surgery, com- bined or not with SSAs, are recommended to decrease the tumour burden, to control hormonal secretions and to prevent local complications, as a first-line thera- peutic approach in patients with advanced slowly pro- gressing LC [V, B].


Systemic anti-tumour therapy
Systemic anti-tumour therapies of patients with advanced LC are various, including SSAs, ChT, everolimus, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and interferon-a (IFN- a) (Figure 4). These systemic therapies should be discussed within expert multidisciplinary teams for patients with morphologically progressive tumours, high tumour burden or refractory functioning syndromes. No specific phase III
 
trial for LC exclusively has been published so far, therefore evidence comes mostly from retrospective analyses, less from phase II, single-arm trials, and sporadically from randomised phase II or subgroups of phase III trials that enrolled a majority of GEP-NET patients. Everolimus is the only treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA for LC. Based on the very limited data available in advanced ThC, we recommend applying the same strategy as for LC.

SSAs
Octreotide [long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg] and lanreotide (120 mg) are the two SSAs most commonly used in clinical practice. Both showed antiproliferative activity and gains in time to progression or progression-free survival (PFS) in placebo-controlled, phase III trials enrolling good prognostic or slowly progressive GEP-NETs,64 where they were approved by the FDA and EMA for antiproliferative pur- poses. The placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial, which evaluated lanreotide 120 mg in advanced LC, was stopped for insufficient enrolment (SPINET trial NCT02683941). Therefore, the feasibility of phase III trials in LC remains an issue. Two dedicated retrospective case series reported potential positive impact of SSAs, with a PFS of 17 and 11 months, respectively.76,77 In the single, published, randomised phase II LUNA trial, pasireotide 60 mg every 4 weeks, in first or second line after standard SSA therapy, achieved a 39% progression-free rate (PFR) at 9 months, in a series of 41 LCs or ThCs with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) progression before enrolment (LUNA study). The PFR was not significantly different from that achieved with everolimus alone.20 On this basis, the authors recommend SSA, for its better tolerability, as first- line therapy in TC or slowly progressing somatostatin re- ceptor (SSTR)-positive LC [IV, C].

Targeted therapies
Everolimus has been investigated in several clinical trials which included metastatic LCs and is currently the most studied agent in LC. The RADIANT-4 study represents the largest series of LCs ever included in a phase III trial (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10
.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).78,79 Based on these results, the FDA and EMA approved everolimus in advanced, pro- gressing, non-functional pulmonary and digestive NETs in 2016. Furthermore, in the RADIANT-4 trial, everolimus delayed tumour progression while preserving overall health-related QoL.80 Everolimus has been reported to be potentially effective also in a post hoc analysis of the RADIANT-2 trial regarding a subgroup of LC associated with a history of CS (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).71,81 Ever- olimus is considered as first-line therapy in the majority of ACs or following progression to SSA for both TC and AC patients [II, B] (see Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003 for detailed LUNA trial data).
 

 
Figure 3. Treatment of functioning syndromes.
In patients with refractory CS, a variety of options exist but there is no consensus on the best strategy, due to the lack of specific LC studies.
ChT, chemotherapy; CS, carcinoid syndrome; EMA, European Medicines Agency; FDA, United States Food and Drug Administration; IFN-a, interferon-a; LC, lung carcinoid; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; SSA, somatostatin analogue.
a Telotristat ethyl is the only second-line EMA- and FDA-approved agent in patients with refractory diarrhoea due to the carcinoid syndrome. When second-line treatment is given for controlling CS, distinct from increased SSA dose or pasireotide, SSA therapy should be maintained until a significant improvement of CS is observed.

 
LC patients were enrolled in several antiangiogenic phase II trials,82,83 dedicated to carcinoids, with partial responses documented in 10%-18% of cases. No sign of increased toxicity was reported as compared with digestive tumours. Recently, a phase III, placebo-controlled trial (SANET) was presented at ESMO 2019 showing a gain in PFS of 5.4 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.334, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.223-0.499, P < 0.001] of surufatinib compared with placebo in 198 Chinese patients  including 11% LC.84 No
recommendation can be made at the present time regarding the use of antiangiogenic agents in LC (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).82-84
Among targetable molecular alterations described in non- small-cell bronchial carcinoma, only echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) rearrangement has been described in a few LC (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).85
 
ChT
Several ChT regimens have been used in metastatic LC. Cisplatin or carboplatin combined with etoposide, the standard ChT for SCLC, has also been used in LC and ThC showing an 8%-23% response rate (RR) and 7-8-month PFS.47,66 More recently, oxaliplatin-based ChT has been re- ported to be active in retrospective analyses of patients with metastatic LC alone or mixed with other primary sites. Oxaliplatin combined with gemcitabine (GEMOX) or cape- citabine (CAPOX) or 5-ﬂuorouracil (FOLFOX) regimens47,86 led to RRs up to 20% and 8-15-month PFS. Streptozocin combined with 5-ﬂuorouracil in three randomised trials, enrolling 8%-12% LCs, resulted in 16%-22% RRs and 5-7- month PFS.87-89 Dacarbazine- or temozolomide-based ChT has shown activity in LC and ThC: an objective RR of 10%- 30% patients and a median PFS of 5-13 months has been reported (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).37,47,90-92 Based on the above, there is currently no shared standard ChT for

a Similar strategies are discussed in unresectable localised lung or thymic carcinoids.
b Including high-grade atypical carcinoids.
c Everolimus has the most solid evidence of efficacy available and is the only approved treatment.
d We recommend alkylating-based ChT as first-line ChT and platinum-based ChT (oxaliplatin-based ChT is favoured by the panel) as second-line ChT in advanced LC patients refractory or intolerant to everolimus therapy [IV, C]. In few cases, with high proliferative ACs (Ki-67 >20%) or rapid growth, platinum-based ChT might be considered upfront (alternatives or second lines include everolimus or PRRT, based on SRI results).
e PRRT should be considered as an alternative to ChT in selected patients (refractory carcinoid syndrome, SRI homogenous positive tumour uptake on all RECIST- evaluable targets). PRRT may be considered first line in a few SRI-positive patients with refractory carcinoid syndrome and progressing or bulky tumours.
f IFN-a should be considered as alternative to ChT especially if refractory carcinoid syndrome. The development of LC- and ThC-dedicated protocols is strongly
encouraged.

 

advanced thoracic NETs. Due to better tolerance and con- venience, we recommend temozolomide (    capecitabine) as first-line and platinum-based ChT as second-line options in patients with progressive advanced LC [IV, C]. Among platinum-based agents, oxaliplatin-based ChT is recom- mended by the majority of the panel [IV, C]. Prospective validation of predictors of response is expected to ratio- nalise the prescription of ChT. We recommend the same strategy in patients with advanced ThC.


PRRT
In NETs, lutetium (177Luoxodotreotide) (177Lu-DOTATATE, Lutathera®) has been approved in Europe and the United States for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic,
 

progressive, well-differentiated (G1 and G2), SSTR-positive GEP-NETs in adults.64,93 Several studies showed that PRRT is also effective in LC and deserves urgent prospective tri- als.70,94-97 See Supplementary Material, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003, for more details about PRRT. Only in the absence of ongoing trials to which patients could be recruited, PRRT is discussed as a potential alternative third-line or fourth-line therapy in patients with all RECIST-evaluable tumour deposits showing a positive uptake on SRI after SSA and everolimus, if available [IV, B].


IFN-a and immunotherapy
In one dedicated study, IFN-a treatment resulted in stabi- lisation of tumour growth in 14% of patients.66 Two
 

 
randomised trials in carcinoids resulted in partial response (PR) of 4%-9% and median PFS of 14-15 months in the IFN-a arm, whether or not combined with SSAs.64,98 Based on these results, IFN-a is still considered an option in pro- gressive metastatic LC, especially in case of uncontrolled CS [IV, B]. Although the preclinical rationale is weak, immu- notherapy is currently being evaluated in NETs with several active trials (Supplementary Material, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003)99 and no conclu- sion can be drawn yet.

High proliferative LC
Based on available data in digestive NETs (GEP-NET G3 sub- group) but also preliminary data in high proliferative LC, the authors recommend treating these patients like they have aggressive AC and not poorly differentiated carcinomas.42,100 Everolimus, ChT and, in selected patients, PRRT, constitute the recommended options in this rare subgroup of patients [V C].

Recommendations
Systemic options should be discussed in an interdisci- plinary setting in patients with advanced carcinoids with bulky tumour or progressing tumours at morpho- logical imaging
SSAs are recommended first-line treatment in patients with TC and/or slowly progressing advanced SRI- positive LC and ThC [IV, C]
Everolimus is recommended either as first line in case of AC or, second-line post-SSA, in patients with TC and or progressive advanced LCs and ThCs [II, B] Dacarbazine/temozolomide-based ChT as first line, and platinum-based ChT as second line, are recommended in advanced LC patients refractory or intolerant to ever- olimus therapy [IV, C]
PRRT (based on positive uptake at SRI on all RECIST- evaluable targets) as alternative second-line (in case of uncontrolled CS) or mainly third-line therapy (beyond SSAs and or everolimus) in morphologically progressive or high tumour burden advanced LC and ThCs is recom- mended [IV, B]
IFN-a as a potential second-line (in case of uncontrolled
CS) or mainly third-line alternative (beyond SSAs and or everolimus) is recommended in morphologically progres- sive or high tumour burden advanced LC and ThCs [IV, B] Upfront everolimus or dacarbazine/temozolomide-based or oxaliplatin-based ChT is recommended, or in selected subgroup PRRT (based on positive uptake at SRI on all RECIST-evaluable targets) in high proliferative ACs [V, C] Since there is limited evidence of efficacy for all treat- ment options, clinical trials should be prioritised.

FOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND SURVIVORSHIP
Follow-up for LCs should be life-long, since recurrences remain very common over time [IV, C].4,7,18,50,51,101-103 Rec- ommendations for follow-up are given in Supplementary
 
Material and Supplementary Table S6, available at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003.
Thymic NET recurrences may be local (if located in the anterior mediastinum), regional (intrathoracic especially pleural) or distant   (Supplementary   Material,   available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003). Radically resected disease and not radically resected, or disseminated disease, should be followed as AC of the lung [V, B]. Patients with disseminated disease may benefit from affiliation to specialised palliative care units concerning pain treatment, psychosocial impact and rehabilitation [II, B].
Recommendations
Follow-up for LC should be life-long, since recurrences remain very common over time [IV, C]
After radical resection of LC, life-long follow-up with low- radiation imaging procedures and increasing interval of time, adjusted to prognostic factors, is recommended [V, C]
Follow-up of LC and ThC patients focuses on tumour and functioning syndrome evaluations as well as evaluations of long-term toxicity and specific conditions including DIPNECH or MEN-1 [V, B]
In patients with advanced tumours, morphological follow-up is recommended every 2-12 months depend- ing on WHO histology, tumour growth rate and control of functioning syndrome [V, C]
Follow-up of ThC is recommended in all patients in a similar        manner        to         ACs         [V,         B] Patients with disseminated disease may benefit from affil- iation to specialised palliative care units concerning pain treatment, psychosocial impact and rehabilitation [II, B].

METHODOLOGY
This Clinical Practice Guideline was developed in accordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical Practice Guidelines development, https://www.esmo.org/ Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology. The relevant literature has been selected by the expert authors. An ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included in Supplementary Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003. ESMO-MCBS v1.1104 was used to calculate scores for new therapies/indications approved by the EMA since 1 January 2016 (https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-MCBS). The scores have been calculated by the ESMO-MCBS Working Group and validated by the ESMO Guidelines Committee. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation have been applied using the system shown in Supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003.105 Statements without grading were considered justified stan- dard clinical practice by the authors.
