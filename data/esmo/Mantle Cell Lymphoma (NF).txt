Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a relatively uncommon subtype of lymphoid malignancy and represents 5%–7% of malignant lymphoma in Western Europe. The annual incidence of this dis- ease has increased during recent decades to 1–2/100 000 recently. MCL is more common in males than in women with a 3 : 1 ratio.


Diagnosis should be based on a surgical specimen, preferably a lymph node biopsy. Core biopsies should only be carried out in patients without easily accessible lymph nodes (e.g. retroperiton- eal bulk), keeping in mind the heterogeneity of MCL. In the rare cases with leukaemic manifestation only, a bone marrow (BM) biopsy may be sufficient if additional diagnostic measures are applied, immunophenotype (CD5þ, CD19/20þ), detection of t(11;14)(q13;q32) and overexpression of cyclin D1. Fine needle aspirations are inappropriate for a reliable evaluation of add- itional risk factors (cytology, cell proliferation).
The histological report should give the diagnosis according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and Ki-67 as the most established histomorphological risk factor [I, A] [1]. Most tumours have a classic morphology of small-medium sized cells with irregular nuclei. However, the malignant lymphocytes may present with a spectrum of morphological variants, includ- ing small round (resembling chronic lymphocytic leukaemia),
 
marginal zone-like, pleomorphic and blastoid cells. In the updated WHO classification, a leukaemic non-nodal subtype has been characterised based on the clinical presentation usually with a more indolent clinical course [1]. As only the minority of these cases is correctly diagnosed based on classical histology only, re- view by an expert haematopathologist is advised. In particular, additional immunohistochemistry for detection of cyclin D1 overexpression is mandatory.
In the rare cyclin D1-negative cases, detection of SOX11 may help to establish the diagnosis [2].
If possible, additional biopsy material should be stored freshly frozen to allow additional molecular analyses (currently still investigational).


 
Since treatment may differ depending on the stage of the disease, initial staging should be thorough, particularly in the rare cases with non-bulky stages I and II (Table 1). Initial work-up should include a computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis, and a BM aspirate and biopsy (Table 2). Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan is especially rec- ommended in the rare limited stages I/II, before localised radio- therapy (RT) [IV, C]. Gastrointestinal endoscopy is also recommended in these rare cases to detect asymptomatic involve- ment but otherwise only in symptomatic patients. Of note, when

carried out according to the Lugano classification system (Table 1), with mention of bulky disease > 5 cm when appro- priate [4].
The evaluation of the cell proliferation antigen Ki-67 is the most applicable method to evaluate cell proliferation, and is con- sidered the most established biological risk factor in MCL. As the reproducibility of quantitative scores among pathologists may vary, a standardised method has been suggested [5].
For prognostic purposes, a combined MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI-c) (Table 3; web-based calculator: www. european-mcl.net/de/clinical_mipi.php) has been   established [I, A] [6, 7].

 




analysed, the majority of MCL patients will have gastrointestinal involvement.
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rare in asymptomatic patients at diagnosis, but a lumbar puncture may be considered in high-risk cases [at least two of the following risk factors: blastoid variant, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), impaired performance status or neurological symptoms] [III, C] [3].
A full blood count, blood chemistry including LDH and uric acid, as well as screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C, are  required. Staging is
 
Leukaemic non-nodal subtype of MCL
Most patients with MCL follow an aggressive clinical course. However, a subset of patients may exhibit a more indolent evolu- tion. Most of these cases are commonly characterised by a leu- kaemic non-nodal presentation with BM involvement only and splenomegaly [1, 8]. SOX11 negativity may help to identify these cases. In addition, conventional MCL (SOX11-positive) with low Ki-67 (≤ 10%) tend to have a more indolent course. However, additional TP53 mutations may cause an aggressive clinical evo- lution (Figure 1) [9].
Unfortunately, there are no markers that definitely predict in- dolent behaviour, but a short course of ‘watch and wait’ period under close observation seems to be appropriate in suspected in- dolent cases with low tumour burden [III, B] [10].

If treatment is required, recommendations for classical MCL apply.


 
First-line

Stages I–II. In the small proportion of patients with limited non- bulky stages I–II, RT (involved field, 30–36 Gy) has been sug- gested to achieve long-term remissions [11]. In contrast, in a randomised study, all patients with early-stage MCL relapsed within 1 year [12]. Thus, a shortened conventional chemotherapy (ChT) induction followed by consolidation RT (similar to diffuse large cell lymphoma) may be the most appropriate treatment in these cases [IV, B].
In stage I–II patients with large tumour burden or adverse prognostic features, systemic therapy as indicated for advanced stages should be applied; consolidation RT may be considered de- pending on tumour location and expected side-effects [IV, B].

Stages III–IV
Induction: In all symptomatic patients and generally in cases with high tumour burden, therapy should be initiated at diagnosis [I, A]. The current therapeutic approach is based on clinical risk factors, symptoms and patient characteristics (Figure 2).
Elderly patients: Based on a median age of 65 years at first diag- nosis, the majority of patients do not qualify for dose-intensified
 
regimens. Three prospective first-line trials, a salvage trial and a systematic meta-analysis support an improved overall response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) if ritux- imab was added to ChT (Table 4) [I, A] [13].
Rituximab in combination with ChT such as CHOP (cyclo- phosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) or bendamustine should be used [I, B] [14–16]. Recently, a com- bination with bortezomib achieved almost doubled median PFS but resulted in significant thrombocytopaenia [17]. Rituximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and pred- nisone (R-CVP) resulted in inferior response rates and PFS [18]. Purine analogue-based schemes, rituximab with fludara- bine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) or with fludarabine and mitoxantrone (R-FM), are also discouraged due to early failures and long-lasting myelosuppression [I, D] [15]. The addition of high-dose cytarabine (HD-AraC) to CHOP is currently being tested in elderly patients. Recently, rituximab, bendamustine and cytarabine (R-BAC) has been explored also in first-line therapy [19].
In frail patients, a less intense immunochemotherapy, chlorambucil or vincristine, doxorubicin, oral dexametha- sone and chlorambucil (VADC) or prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine and cyclophosphamide (PEP-C) may be con- sidered, aiming primarily at palliation [II, B]. However, tar- geted therapy exhibiting a low toxicity profile might be used in this population [20].
Antibody monotherapy [rituximab, radioimmunotherapy (RIT)] achieves only moderate response rates and is therefore not recommended [III, B] [21].

In patients with positive hepatitis B serology, prophylactic antiviral medication and/or virus load monitoring is strongly rec- ommended [I, A] [22].

Consolidation/maintenance. Rituximab maintenance significantly improves PFS and OS after rituximab and CHOP (R-CHOP) [I, A] and PFS in a systematic meta-analysis [15, 23].
RIT consolidation also prolongs PFS after ChT, but its benefit seems to be inferior in comparison to rituximab maintenance [II, B] [24].

Younger patients: Although no curative treatment is available for MCL so far, an intensive approach, e.g. by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), has been demonstrated to induce higher response and survival rates in fit patients, independently of the addition of rituximab [I, B] (Table 5) [25–27].
 
In addition, a randomised trial confirmed that a cytarabine- containing induction achieves a significantly improved median time to treatment failure (P ¼ 0.038) [I, B] [28]. In contrast, an induction-based on HD-AraC alone achieves only insufficient re- sponse rates [III, D] [29].
In a retrospective study comparison of the Nordic, HOVON and MCL Younger protocols, total body irradiation (TBI) before ASCT was confirmed to be beneficial only in partial response (PR) patients [II, B] [30]. In contrast, the benefit of RIT has not been demonstrated in inter-study comparisons.
An upfront dose-intensified approach (R-hyper-CVAD, rit- uximab in combination with hyperfractionated cyclophospha- mide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine cycles) also achieved very high response and survival rates in phase II studies, but its feasibility is hampered by a significant therapy-associated

toxicity [II, C] [31–33] and low success rate of stem cell mobilisation.
Rituximab maintenance following a rituximab with dexa- methasone, cytarabine and cisplatin (R-DHAP)-based induction and ASCT improves PFS and OS and represents the current standard of care [I, A] [27].
So far, there are no data to support the application of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) as part of front-line treatment [II, D] [34].


Relapsed disease
A repeated biopsy is recommended to identify important prog- nostic features of MCL.
Selection of salvage treatment depends on efficacy of prior regimens. In early relapses (< 12–24 months), a non- cross-resistant scheme should be preferred [bendamustine or HD-AraC-containing regimens, e.g. rituximab, bendamustine and cytarabine (R-BAC)] after CHOP or vice versa [19].
Rituximab should be added if the previous antibody- containing scheme achieved > 6 months duration of remission [IV, B].
In cases of early relapses or in refractory cases, newer tar- geted approaches should be strongly considered (Figure 2; Table 6). Among the registered compounds, ibrutinib achieves the highest response rates and, in some cases, long-term remis- sions [35–37], but early relapses display very aggressive fea- tures. When there are contraindications to ibrutinib therapy, particularly a high risk of bleeding, lenalidomide (preferable in combination with rituximab) may also achieve ongoing re- missions in some cases [38–41]. Temsirolimus and bortezo- mib have been shown to be effective but should preferably be
 
applied in combination with ChT based on phase II/III studies [17, 42–45].
Rituximab maintenance has a favourable safety profile and prolongs PFS and OS in relapsed disease [I, A] [46]. However, second-line maintenance approaches have not been investigated in patients relapsing after front-line maintenance [IV, D].
RIT consolidation seems to result in extended remission dur- ations [47, 48] especially in elderly patients with comorbidities not eligible for dose intensification [IV, B].
High-dose ChT with ASCT may be considered in patients relapsed after conventional first-line therapy. However, the bene- fit seems to be marginal in this setting [49], and there is no role for a second autograft at relapse.
In younger patients, alloSCT is potentially curative and has achieved long-term remissions even in patients following early relapse and with refractory disease [III, B]. Based on the advanced age of most patients, dose-reduced conditioning is appropriate [IV, B] [50]. Haploidentical BM transplant- ation achieves high response rates but is still experimental in MCL.

Response evaluation
PET-CT according to the Lugano classification for response evaluation is optional [4].
Radiological tests should be carried out mid- and post- completion of ChT. Patients who achieve less than a PR should be considered for early salvage regimens. Patients achieving a PR may convert to a complete response after post-induction treatment.
The independent prognostic role of minimal residual disease (MRD) applying patient-specific primers has been confirmed in numerous studies [51, 52].  However, because of the current

limitations in knowing how to react, especially in MRD-positive patients, its use is advised in clinical trials but not recommended in clinical routine, except for the setting of donor lymphocyte in- fusion post-allograft.
 

 
 
In this disease setting, more research is needed to identify mo- lecular markers, which could translate into a more personalised approach.
 
The selection of the optimal treatment of any given patient is based mainly on clinical and biological risk factors, symptoms and tumour load (Figure 2). PET and MRD-based tailored treat- ments are currently being evaluated in studies but are not yet part of routine clinical practice.
New agents, especially other inhibitors targeting the B-cell re- ceptor (BCR) pathway, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) or cyclin- dependent kinases (CDK), are currently being investigated [53].


Follow-up, long-term implications and	
survivorship	
The following recommendations are based on consensus rather than on evidence (see Table 7):
•	History and physical examination, blood counts and routine chemistry every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 additional years and, subsequently, once a year [V, D].
•	Annual evaluation of thyroid function in patients after irradi- ation of the neck.
•	Optional CT scan (or ultrasound examinations to reduce ra- diation exposure) every 3–6 months for 2 years and every 6– 12 months up to 5 years. However, there is no strong evidence to support a regular radiological follow-up. These recommen- dations are driven by the concern to minimise radiation ex- posure and lack of evidence for survival advantage conferred with routine surveillance imaging. PET-CT should not be used for surveillance.
•	Some studies suggest that pre-emptive treatment may be efﬁ- cient. However, MRD screening may be carried out but should not guide therapeutic strategies outside clinical studies.


 
These Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accord- ance with the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical Practice Guidelines development http://www.esmo.org/ Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology. The relevant lit- erature has been selected by the expert authors. A summary of recommended treatment strategies outside of clinical studies is provided in Figure 2, and a summary of recommendations is provided in Table 8. Levels of evidence and grades of recom- mendation have been applied using the system shown in Table 9. Statements without grading were considered justified standard clinical practice by the experts and the ESMO Faculty. This manuscript has been subjected to an anonymous peer re- view process.
