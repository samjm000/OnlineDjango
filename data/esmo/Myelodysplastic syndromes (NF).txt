INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal haemato- poietic stem cell (HSC) disorders predominating in the elderly, characterised by ineffective haematopoiesis leading to blood cytopaenias and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in one-fourth to one-third of cases.1 Their pathophysiology is characterised by a multi-step process involving cytogenetic changes and/or gene mutations,2 ab- normalities of the bone marrow microenvironment3 and widespread gene hypermethylation at advanced stages.4,5
Median age at diagnosis of MDS is w70 years and <10% are younger than 50 years.6 The incidence of MDS is about
4 cases/100 000 inhabitants/year (reaching 40-50/100 000 in patients aged 70 years).6 There are no known ethnic differences in the incidence of MDS, but in Asian pop- ulations, MDS tends to occur at an earlier age, more often with a hypocellular marrow and less often with isolated 5q deletion (‘5q-syndrome’). Trisomy 8 also seems to occur more frequently in Asian populations compared with Western populations.7
The aetiology of MDS is only known in 15% of cases. An inherited predisposition to MDS is seen in one-third of paediatric MDS patients, including Down syndrome, Fan- coni anaemia and neurofibromatosis. It is less frequent in adults, but an inherited predisposition should be assessed in MDS occurring in young adults or families with other

cases of MDS, AML or aplastic anaemia. Point mutations of several genes including DDX 41, GATA2, RUNX 1, ANKRD 26, ETV6 and telomerase complex genes (TERC, TERT) have been found in such familial cases.8 Environmental factors include previous exposure to chemotherapy (ChT), espe- cially alkylating agents and purine analogues,9 radiotherapy (RT) or ionising radiation10,11 and tobacco smoking.12 Rec- ognised occupational factors include benzene and its de- rivatives,13 and more cases of MDS are reported among agricultural and industrial workers.12,14 Cases of ‘secondary MDS’, particularly those occurring after ChT (therapy- related MDS), generally have poor prognostic factors, including complex cytogenetic findings involving chromo- somes 5 and/or 7 and/or 17p.15
DIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Diagnosis of MDS is based on blood and bone marrow ex- amination, showing blood cytopaenias, generally hyper- cellular (but sometimes hypocellular) marrow with dysplasia, with or without an excess of blasts.16
Well-established diagnostic tools for MDS with wide- spread availability are peripheral and differential blood counts, cytomorphology of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears and cytogenetics of bone marrow cells [I, A]. At diagnosis, histology of bone marrow trephine biopsies is strongly recommended, especially to exclude other cau- ses of cytopaenia and because of its potential prognostic information [I, A]. In difficult cases, such as cytopaenias with unspecific morphological changes and no cytogenetic changes, molecular analysis by next generation sequencing techniques to demonstrate clonality [I, A] and, in experi- enced hands, ﬂow cytometry of blood and marrow cells can be useful for diagnosis [II, B].
Differential diagnoses of MDS include a history of medi- cation or ingestion of alcohol or other drugs and exclusion
 

of other diseases, including autoimmune disorders, renal failure, malignancies, chronic infections, aplastic anaemia and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).17
MDS should be classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria16 with prognosis established by the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS)18 or rather, its revised version (IPSS-R).19 Prognosis is based on the marrow blast percentage, number and extent of cyto- paenias, and cytogenetic abnormalities, which are grouped
18,19
in the IPSS-R.	Treatment varies from symptomatic
 
therapy for cytopaenias, especially transfusions, to alloge- neic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).

Peripheral blood counts and differential blood counts
Almost all patients with MDS have blood cytopaenias, mostly anaemia (usually macrocytic) with or without other cytopaenias.

Laboratory parameters
Laboratory values supporting or excluding the diagnosis of MDS are ferritin, transferrin and transferrin saturation, reticulocyte counts, vitamin B12 and folate concentrations, haptoglobin, and creatinine levels. They can exclude the differential diagnoses of iron deficiency anaemia, haemo- lytic anaemia, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency and renal anaemia. If MDS is diagnosed, ferritin and lactate dehy- drogenase (LDH) also have some prognostic value, and the erythropoietin (EPO) level can support a decision for or against treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Diagnostic work-up for PNH may be considered in cases with a clinical suspicion as small PNH clones can accompany MDS.

Cytomorphology
The hallmarks of cytomorphology in MDS are dysplastic features in	10% of marrow and/or peripheral blood cells of erythroid, granulocytic or megakaryocytic lineage. Marrow histology of trephine biopsies is of additional value. In early MDS with only mild morphological abnormalities, certain cases with persistent, unexplained cytopaenias are called idiopathic cytopaenias of uncertain significance (ICUS). In patients with marrow dysplastic features but no or very mild peripheral blood cytopaenias and normal kar- yotype, idiopathic dysplasia of unknown significance (IDUS)20 can be diagnosed if no other cause of dysplasia is apparent (see Table 1). Patients with clonal somatic muta- tions and cytopaenias without dysplastic features and normal karyotype [clonal cytopaenias of uncertain signifi- cance (CCUS)] constitute a third group of patients with a
higher risk of progression to MDS.21,22
When evaluating MDS blood films and marrow slides, certain cytological abnormalities should be considered (see Table 2). For an MDS diagnosis, the recommended number of cells to be reviewed per slide is 200 for the blood film and up to 500 for bone marrow.23 The marrow blast count is crucial given its important prognostic value. ‘Blasts’ should include agranular blasts, myeloblasts and promonocytes but

not promyelocytes. Staining for iron with Prussian blue (Perls stain) should always be carried out in lower-risk MDS in order to evaluate the presence of ring sideroblasts.

Histopathology
In the European Union (EU), contrary to the United States, MDS are mainly followed-up by bone marrow aspirate rather than biopsy. Bone marrow trephine biopsy, however, is useful at diagnosis to assess cellularity and fibrosis. In case of hypocellular aspirates or dry puncture, it allows a diagnosis of hypoplastic MDS or fibrotic MDS. It may also exclude other differential diagnoses and may provide additional information on dysplastic features (mainly of megakaryocytes) and prognostic information, especially by showing fibrosis. It is therefore strongly recommended in addition to bone marrow aspiration at diagnosis.24,25

Cytogenetics
In MDS, clonal chromosome abnormalities are observed in 30% to >80% of patients.26 In the remaining 20%-70% of patients with a normal karyotype, sub-microscopic alter- ations such as point mutations, microdeletions or
 
amplifications, epigenetic changes or copy number neutral loss such as uniparental disomy (UPD) provide the genetic basis for the disease.2,27 Currently, standard karyotype still has the highest prognostic value of all IPSS-R parameters.19 Chromosome banding analysis is carried out on dividing metaphase cells. Whenever possible, 20-25 metaphases should be analysed so as not to miss smaller cell clones that are frequent, especially in low-risk MDS. Complex abnor- malities are defined as three or more independent abnor- malities in at least two metaphases.28 Cytogenetic analysis should follow minimal standards fixed by the ‘Workpackage Cytogenetics’ of the European LeukemiaNet (see Figure 1).29 In an international database of 2124 patients with MDS, 52% had one or more clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. Abnormal karyotypes were clearly associated with the severity of MDS, increasing with marrow blast count and
the intensity of dysplasias.26
Several independent studies have proven the dismal outcome related to complex abnormalities.26,30,31 Complex

associated with a 13-fold increased risk of developing a haematological neoplasia and a 1.4-fold risk of death also related to an increased incidence of atherosclerotic car- diovascular disease.43
Patients with CHIP and unexplained cytopaenia but no morphological evidence for myelodysplasia have been classified as CCUS. Over 30% of patients with unexplained cytopaenias appear to have CCUS, with an increased risk of developing myeloid neoplasia depending on the type of mutation.37,44

a Other mutations are seen in <5% of cases.

 


abnormalities can be further subdivided by the presence or absence of TP53 mutations, the number of cytogenetic changes and severe anaemia.32
Assessing karyotype during follow-up is also useful as cytogenetic progression is associated with poorer prognosis, while cytogenetic response after a given treatment may be associated with a better outcome.31,33,34

Molecular genetics
Acquired molecular mutations are seen in 80%-90% of MDS patients,35,36 affecting epigenetic regulation and chromatin- remodelling   (TET2,   DNMT3A,   ASXL1,   IDH1/2,   EZH2),
pre-mRNA splicing factors (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1), tran- scription (TP53, RUNX1) and signal transduction (NRAS, CBL), and can demonstrate clonal disease (Table 3). The most frequent mutations (each present in >10% of patients) affect TET2, SF3B1, ASXL1, SRSF2, DNMT3A and RUNX1, but approximately one or more of around 30 genes are mutated in >1% of patients. Forty percent of patients have more than one mutation. Most mutations, except SF3B1, carry a poor prognosis, and prognosis is worse with a larger number of mutations.35 Molecular profiling can also be a valuable diagnostic tool if MDS is uncertain in ICUS or IDUS,37 but mutations have limited impact on the clinical management in most cases. Exceptions are SF3B1 mutation in lower-risk MDS (associated with a favourable prognosis and likely to respond to luspatercept) and TP53 mutation in lower-risk MDS with del(5q), associated with an increased risk   of   leukaemic   transformation,   lower   cytogenetic
response rate and shorter response duration to lenalido- mide (LEN).38

Clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential
Somatic mutations seen in myeloid neoplasias have been observed in elderly healthy persons (10%-13% of those aged 70-80 years).39-41 The most frequently affected gene is DNMT3A, followed by TET2, ASXL1, and less often, JAK2, PPM1D, SF3B1, SRSF2 and TP53. Most patients have only one mutation, and generally with variant allele frequency (VAF) of 10%. Since individuals examined had no obvious haematological disease, the term ‘clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential’ (CHIP) was established.42 CHIP is
 
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry abnormalities of myeloid precursors may support a diagnosis of MDS, but this method should be used by experts according to published guidelines, and should not be used for the evaluation of the percentage of bone marrow blasts.45,46

Classiﬁcation
The current WHO classification of MDS16 divides MDS with
<5% blasts into those with single lineage or multilineage dysplasia (Table 4). In MDS with single lineage dysplasia, patients with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) have a low AML progression rate and generally have a prolonged overall survival (OS) if SF3B1 mutation is present and is isolated or
at least not associated with poor prognosis mutations such as RUNX1 mutation. The entity of del(5q) MDS is not defined by morphological criteria but by the presence of del(5q), making cytogenetic analysis mandatory. This clas- sification has recognised entities with germline predisposi- tion (Table 5).8 Finally, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia has been moved to myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.16

Recommendations
Diagnosis is based on blood count, marrow aspirate and marrow karyotype [I, A].
Bone marrow biopsy is recommended at diagnosis [I, A]. Molecular biology is useful for diagnosis if blood and marrow tests are inconclusive [I, A].
Flow cytometry of blood and marrow cells is useful for diagnosis in experienced hands [II, B].


STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
The natural course of MDS is highly variable, with survival ranging from a few weeks to many years. Causes of death are mainly related to MDS in higher-risk patients, while a large proportion of patients with lower-risk MDS die of non- MDS causes, i.e. comorbidities associated with the typical age of MDS patients.47,48 Median OS is 15-30 months and the 5-year AML progression rate is 25%-35%. Bone marrow failure (infection and haemorrhage) is the leading cause of death before AML progression.49
The main risk factors, allowing an individual risk-adapted treatment strategy, are cytogenetic abnormalities, marrow

blasts percentage and number and severity of cytopaenias. The IPSS18 and IPSS-R19 (Table 6) are based on these vari- ables. They have been validated in external series50 and their use is strongly recommended for planning treatment51 [I, A]. The IPSS-R is used to stratify patients into five risk
 
groups (very low-, low-, intermediate-, high- and very high- risk), with clear differences in OS and risk of progression to AML,19 and offers better prognostic classification than the IPSS. For therapeutic purposes, the term ‘lower-risk’ MDS generally applies to cases with IPSS-R up to 3.5 including very low- and low-risk and part of intermediate-risk IPSS-R patients. ‘Higher-risk’ MDS includes patients with IPSS-R 4.0, i.e. high- and very high-risk, and the remaining intermediate-risk IPSS-R patients. There is obviously some uncertainty for intermediate-risk IPSS-R patients where the treatment approach should take additional factors into
account.

inhibitors. The diagnostic strategy may be adapted accord- ing to the availability of new targeted therapies.
Finally, most prognostic factors in MDS have been established independently of treatment, particularly in co- horts receiving mostly supportive care. With the availability of treatments having an impact on disease evolution, including allo-SCT and hypomethylating agents (HMAs), factors that may be prognostic in patients treated with these interventions are starting to be defined.

Recommendations
IPSS-R is required for prognostic evaluation [I, A]. Molecular analysis may add prognostic value [II, B], espe- cially for TP53 [in del(5q) MDS] and SF3B1 mutations in patients with <5% blasts [I, A].

TREATMENT
Response criteria in MDS
Response criteria to treatment in MDS are based on recom- mendations of an international working group (IWG 2006).55 These criteria define (i) responses aimed at modifying the disease course [mainly allo-SCT, intensive ChT and HMAs, including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression], and (ii) improvement of cytopaenias (‘haematological improvement’ or HI) in one or several lineages (erythroid, platelet and neutrophil re- sponses). These recommendations are particularly adapted to treatments which, like growth factors, can improve these cytopaenias with no obvious effect on the disease course. While CR and PR are generally associated with improvement in cytopaenias, the latter type of response is often defined as ‘stable disease with HI (on the erythroid and/or platelet and/ or neutrophil) lineage’. An international group of MDS experts has recently proposed a revision to these criteria (IWG 2018).56
 
Treatment of higher-risk MDS patients
Higher-risk MDS carries a major risk of progression to AML and short survival, and treatment should aim to modify the dis- ease course, with options including allo-SCT, HMAs and, less frequently, ChT (mainly intensive anthracycline-cytarabine combinations).57 In most patients with higher-risk MDS, HMAs are the first-line reference treatment (Figure 2).

HMAs. In patients with higher-risk MDS without major comorbidities who are not immediately eligible for allo-SCT, azacitidine is recommended [I, A]. The use of azacitidine may be preferable compared with the alternative HMA, decitabine, since findings from a randomised trial showed that azacitidine was superior to conventional care regimens [i.e. supportive care, low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) and AML- like ChT],58,59 whereas there was no clear survival advan- tage with decitabine over conventional treatment in two phase III trials. Of note, while the pivotal AZA-001 phase III trial58 suggested that azacitidine could yield a median OS of 24 months in higher-risk MDS, most large ‘real life’ studies have suggested a median OS of 15-18 months, a difference often observed between patients included in clinical trials versus all-comers.60
As most patients only respond to azacitidine after several courses, at least six courses are recommended as part of the following schedule: azacitidine 75 mg/m2/day subcutane- ously for 7 consecutive days every 28 days [II, B]. However, ‘5-2-2’ regimens (from Monday to Friday, and Monday and Tuesday of the following week) are often easier to apply and are considered acceptable.
Besides induction of CR and PR, achievement of HI ac- cording to IWG 2006 criteria is associated with a prolon- gation of survival compared with supportive care or LDAC [III, B].61
The use of 2-6 cycles of azacitidine is quite common before haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to reduce blasts in bone marrow or for logistical reasons (to

allow time to find an adequate SCT donor). Its potential risks and benefits over no treatment are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [III, B].
AML-like ChT. AML-like intensive ChT has a limited indication in patients with higher-risk MDS. In particular, MDS patients with an unfavourable karyotype show few CRs and shorter CR duration than those with a normal karyotype.62-64 It can be envisaged for fit patients (generally <70 years of age) without unfavourable cytogenetics (especially patients with a normal karyotype) and >10% marrow blasts, preferably as a bridge to allo-SCT [I, B].
Suggested regimens with equivalent efficacy are combi- nations of cytarabine with idarubicin, or ﬂudarabine [IV, B].57 A direct comparison between AML-like ChT and azaciti- dine has been carried out in a small number of MDS pa- tients in one randomised phase III trial. This suggested a superiority of the HMA in terms of survival (but not CR rate) without reaching statistical significance, but the number of patients was too small to draw any definitive conclusions.58 A retrospective comparison of AML-like ChT versus decita- bine was carried out in two groups of matched MDS pa- tients, and while CR rates were equivalent, a survival
advantage was seen only with the use of an HMA.65 Recently, CPX 351, an encapsulated form of daunorubicin
and     cytarabine,     proved     superior     to     conventional
 
daunorubicin and cytarabine in AML with MDS features and AML post-MDS (AML with myelodysplasia-related changes according to WHO 2016 classification16), and it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Euro- pean Medicines Agency (EMA) in those AML subsets, including therapy-related AML.66 Whether it is also superior to conventional ChT in higher-risk MDS needs to be demonstrated.

Low-dose ChT. LDAC (generally cytarabine 20 mg/m2/day for 10-14 days/4 weeks) was inferior to azacitidine (in terms of response and survival) in a randomised phase III study,58 especially in patients with unfavourable cytogenetics.67,68

New treatments (especially in combination with an HMA). Clinical trials are testing whether the addition of another drug to azacitidine can improve outcomes, but so far no combi- nation has demonstrated a clear advantage over azacitidine alone, although some are promising in elderly patients with AML treated with an HMA-based approach.69-71 New HMAs with a longer half-life (potentially increasing the hypo- methylating effect) are currently being tested in MDS (and AML), especially oral drugs.72,73
IPSS higher-risk MDS patients who fail to respond to HMAs have a very poor survival (median <6 months) unless
 

 
they are potentially eligible for allo-SCT.74 The recom- mended approach is to enrol these patients into a clinical trial with investigational agents [IV, B].74
The IDH1 inhibitor, ivosidenib, and IDH2 inhibitor, enasi- denib, have shown significant activity in AML with the respective mutations and are approved by the FDA in those settings.75,76 They are also being tested in clinical trials in MDS, which carries IDH1/2 mutations in around 15% of cases. Of note, those mutations may be absent at HMA onset and appear later in the disease course at HMA failure. The bcl2 inhibitor, venetoclax, is approved by the FDA in combination with an HMA in elderly patients with AML and is also being tested in higher-risk MDS, especially in com- bination with azacitidine.71
allo-SCT. allo-SCT remains the only potentially curative treatment of higher-risk MDS patients [I, A], but its major obstacle is age as most MDS patients are >70 years. Co- morbidity, age, IPSS-R score, cytogenetics, mutations including TP53 mutation,77 conditioning regimen and donor selection are predictors of post-transplant outcome78,79 and should be considered during the decision process. All pa- tients with higher-risk MDS up to 70 years (although particularly ‘fit’ patients aged >70 years can sometimes be considered) should be evaluated for allo-SCT eligibility at diagnosis and whenever required during the disease course. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical (or single antigen mismatched) siblings or matched unrelated individuals should be considered as suitable donors [I, A].79 Hap- loidentical donors and, less often, cord blood are now widely used as alternative donors with comparable out- comes [II, B].
Regarding conditioning regimens, whether reduced- intensity conditioning (RIC) or myeloablative approaches should be used is often disputed. The relapse risk seems to be higher in patients receiving RIC; therefore, patients aged
<55 years and without comorbidities should probably be offered myeloablative HSCT [II, B].
It is debated whether treatment aimed at reducing the blast count should be carried out before allo-SCT with AML- like ChT or HMAs. This is generally considered when marrow blasts are >10%, especially for non-myeloablative allo-SCT [III, A].80
It is now widely accepted that systemic iron overload contributes to negative outcomes after allo-HSCT in MDS.81 Elevated labile plasma iron levels before or during allo-HSCT predict an increased incidence of infection-related non- relapse mortality and a decreased OS in patients with AML or MDS. Therefore, eligible patients should receive appro- priate iron chelation, at least until the onset of conditioning treatment [III, B].81,82

Treatment of lower-risk MDS
In lower-risk MDS, the risk of AML progression is lower, and around half of elderly patients die of causes other than MDS or AML. The main priority is therefore generally the treat- ment of cytopaenias, mainly of anaemia (usually the pre- dominant cytopaenia), and improvement in quality of life
 
(QoL). Still, some of these patients may be identified as having a poorer prognosis, either by their IPSS-R score19 or by other biological characteristics like somatic mutations83 or subsequently by their resistance to first-line treat- ment,84 and may benefit from treatments generally applied to higher-risk MDS [IV, C]. This applies particularly to pa- tients with an intermediate IPSS-R (Figure 3).
Anaemia due to failure of specific treatments often re- quires repeated RBC transfusions, leading to potential iron overload.58
Treatment of anaemia.

RBC transfusions or drugs? Chronic RBC transfusions can be considered as the sole treatment of anaemia in lower- risk MDS as very few drugs are approved in this setting and none have demonstrated a survival improvement except ESA. However, repeated RBC transfusions are asso- ciated with chronic anaemia, leading to excessive morbidity, and they cannot completely correct impaired QoL.85,86 Iron overload due to RBC transfusions may also be deleterious to various organs.85,87 Receiving ESAs has no impact on pro- gression to AML but is an independent, favourable prog- nostic factor for survival [IV, B].88-91
First-line treatment of anaemia in lower-risk MDS. Patients without del(5q): ESAs. ESAs, i.e. recombinant EPO or darbepoetin (DAR), remain the first choice treatment of
anaemia in most lower-risk MDS without del(5q).88 Weekly doses of 30 000-80 000 units of EPO or 150-300 mg of DAR injection yield 40%-60% erythroid responses according to IWG 2006 response criteria55 when the baseline EPO level is low (<200-500 U/l) and transfusion requirement is absent or limited since low baseline serum EPO level and low or no RBC transfusion requirement are the two main prognostic factors of response to ESAs [I, A].86,88-90,92,93
Efficacy of ESAs can be improved by the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),90,94 but there are no data showing that one ESA is superior to another. Only one ESA, i.e. EPO alpha (and its biosimilars), is formally approved by the EMA for lower-risk MDS patients with serum EPO levels below 200 U/l.92
Responses to ESA occur within 8-12 weeks of treatment. Median duration of response is 20-24 months.86,88-90,92
Lower-risk MDS with del(5q): LEN. Anaemia of lower-risk MDS with del(5q) is associated with lower response rates and significantly shorter responses to ESA compared with other lower-risk MDS.95 However, it responds to LEN in 60%-65% of patients, with a median duration of RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) of 2-2.5 years [I, A].96,97 The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/day for 3 weeks every 4 weeks.98 Cytogenetic response (CyR) is achieved in 50%-75% of patients (including 30%-45% complete CyR). TP53 gene mutations, found in w20% of lower-risk MDS with del(5q), confer resistance to LEN and a higher risk of AML progression.38 Thus, patients with del(5q) lower-risk MDS harbouring or developing a TP53 mutation (during LEN treatment) require intensified disease surveillance,

including regular bone marrow assessment of clonal evo- lution [III, A]. Patients with a chromosomal abnormality in addition to del(5q) appear to have similar outcomes to those with isolated del(5q), except for some additional abnormalities like   8,97    7 or del(7q), or when there are two or more additional abnormalities, but those patients are not classified as lower-risk MDS.96,97
Grade 3 or 4 neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia, seen in w60% of patients during the first weeks of treatment, constitute the most common adverse events of LEN.96,97 Close monitoring of blood counts is therefore required during this period, with dose reduction and/or addition of G-CSF if required.
In the EU, LEN is approved for the treatment of lower-risk MDS with del(5q) and RBC-TD only after failure or ineligi- bility to ESA.

Second-line treatments for anaemia in lower-risk MDS. Patients without del(5q). Treatment after ESA failure (primary or secondary resistance) in patients who remain with IPSS low or intermediate-1 MDS is disappointing, with most patients eventually requiring long-term RBC transfusions. Second-line
 
treatments currently used, but not approved in most coun- tries, include anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), HMAs and LEN. ATG,	cyclosporine, can yield an erythroid response (associated with response of other cytopaenias, especially thrombocytopaenia) in 25%-40% of patients [II, B].99-101 ATG results are better in relatively young (<65 years), lower-risk MDS patients with a recent RBC transfusion history, normal
karyotype (or possibly trisomy 8), no excess blasts and HLA DR15 genotype, and in patients with thrombocytopaenia, a small PNH clone or with marrow hypocellularity [III, B].102 Therefore, this treatment is generally proposed to a minor- ity of patients. As in aplastic anaemia, horse ATG appears to achieve better results than rabbit ATG.101
HMAs yield RBC-TI in 20%-40% of patients,103,104 and may also improve other cytopaenias in lower-risk MDS [III, B].105 They are approved in this setting in several countries, including the United States, but not in Europe.
LEN yields an RBC-TI in 25%-30% of lower-risk MDS pa- tients without del(5q) resistant to ESA,106,107 and the combination of LEN and ESA may yield higher RBC-TI rates than LEN alone in this setting [I, B].108 However, LEN is not approved in non-del(5q) patients.
 

 
Luspatercept (ACE-536) has recently shown promising results in RBC transfusion-dependent, lower-risk MDS, with erythroid response and RBC-TI of 63% and 38%, respectively, with limited toxicity in a phase II study, and even better results in patients with MDS-RS or SF3B1 mutation. Results were confirmed in a phase III placebo-controlled randomised study of luspatercept in RBC transfusion-dependent IPSS-R very low-, low- or intermediate-risk MDS-RS or with SF3B1 mutation refractory to ESA,109 and this drug has recently been approved in this setting by the FDA and EMA [I, A].110
Patients with del(5q). Resistance to LEN in lower-risk MDS with del(5q) is associated with a poor prognosis, even if no immediate progression to high-risk MDS is observed. Pa- tients with TP53 gene mutation may have a particularly poor outcome38 and are considered candidates for ap- proaches that have demonstrated a survival benefit in higher-risk MDS, including HMAs, and whenever possible, allo-SCT [IV, B].108

Treatment of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia. In lower-risk MDS, neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia are less frequent than anaemia, and are rarely isolated or profound.
Neutrophils are <1500/mm3 in only 7% of lower-risk MDS, and neutropaenia is rarely associated with life-threatening
infections if no drugs worsening neutropaenia are used. G- CSF can improve neutropaenia in 60%-75% of these cases and can be added to anti-infective drugs [III, C], but its prolonged use has not demonstrated any impact on survival.
Platelets below 50 000/mm3 are seen in w30% of low-risk MDS. High-dose androgens can improve thrombocytopaenia in one-third of thrombocytopaenic lower-risk MDS, but response is generally transient [III, C].111,112 The thrombo- poietin (TPO) receptor agonist (TPO-RA), romiplostim, at high doses (500-1000 mg/week) yielded a 55% platelet
response in a phase II trial in patients with lower-risk MDS and thrombocytopaenia. However, in w15% of patients, a transient rise in marrow blasts and/or the appearance of peripheral blasts was seen which was reversible after drug discontinuation.113 In a randomised phase II study versus placebo in patients with lower-risk MDS and thrombocyto- paenia, romiplostim significantly reduced the incidence of severe bleeding and platelet transfusions.114 While there was a suspected increase in AML risk upon first analysis, this was not confirmed by later follow-up.114 Results of a rand- omised trial in lower-risk MDS patients treated with eltrombopag, an oral TPO-RA, showed a 47% platelet response and a reduction in bleeding events with no obvious safety concerns and no observed rise in marrow blasts.115 TPO-RAs are not approved for MDS in Europe and currently cannot be recommended outside of clinical trials or registries at this time. They should also be restricted to pa- tients without an excess of marrow blasts [II, C].
ATG cyclosporine (in selected cases, as described above) and HMAs achieve platelet response in 35%-40% of cases of lower-risk MDS in addition to erythroid responses [III, C]99-101 (see Figures 2 and 3).
 
Supportive care and chelation therapy in MDS
Supportive care is required in all MDS patients at some point in the disease and may be the only long-term treat- ment for unfit patients and those not responding to the agents described above. In patients requiring repeated RBC transfusions, administration at a sufficiently high haemo- globin threshold is recommended (i.e. at least 8 g/dl, and 9 g/dl or even 10g/dl in cases of comorbidities or poor functional tolerance). A sufficient number of RBC concen- trates should be transfused each time, over 2 or 3 days if needed, to increase the haemoglobin level above 10 g/dl and limit the effects of chronic anaemia, especially on QoL [IV, A].
Aside from patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs, prophylactic platelet transfusions are not commonly used. Prophylactic antibiotics and/or G-CSF are not recommended in case of neutropaenia, but rapid onset of broad-spectrum antibiotics is mandatory in case of fever or symptoms of infection [II, A]. Short-term use of G-CSF during severe in- fections could be useful in neutropaenic patients.
Psychosocial support and contact with patient support groups should be offered.
A debate exists about the deleterious effect of iron overload in MDS patients and the role of iron chelation in those patients. While heart iron overload is a well- documented cause of heart failure in children with thal- assaemia,116,117 its clinical consequences are less certain in transfused MDS patients, particularly as many have other causes of cardiac morbidity.118,119 However, car- diovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging studies show that heart iron overload [reﬂected by a decrease in T2-star (T2*) CMR imaging] is frequent in patients who
have received at least 70-80 RBC concentrates, a frequent situation in low-risk MDS, and that heart T2* <20 milli- seconds is associated with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and a risk of heart failure.120 Retro- spective studies suggest that adequate chelation in highly- transfused patients may improve their survival [IV, C].98,121 The TELESTO trial prospectively examined iron chelation in lower-risk MDS, suggesting a significant improvement   in   event-free   survival   in   chelated   pa-
tients.122 However, this was a composite endpoint, including survival and cardiac and liver function.
Published recommendations for iron chelation therapy [I, V]123 generally advocate starting chelation in patients with a relatively favourable prognosis (i.e. low- or inter- mediate-1-risk MDS) who have received 20-60 RBC con- centrates, or if serum ferritin rises above 1000-2500 U/l. Potential candidates for allo-SCT should, however, be chelated early. Indeed, although the underlying mecha- nisms are unclear, it appears that even a relatively moder- ate iron overload before allo-SCT is associated with increased transplant-related mortality [III, B].81,82,124 Che- lation may also be strongly recommended in patients with lower-risk MDS who are not candidates for allo-SCT but have signs of major iron overload, including significantly reduced cardiac T2* by MRI imaging [III, B].
 

 
Iron chelation is made easier by the availability of oral iron chelators (especially deferasirox) in addition to the classical parenteral deferoxamine. Deferasirox cannot be used in patients with renal failure.125 Deferiprone, another oral iron chelator, is currently not approved for use in MDS in most countries because it can also cause neutropaenia in a small number of patients, which is problematic in MDS.126

Recommendations
Azacitidine is recommended in patients with higher-risk MDS without major comorbidities not immediately eligible for allo-SCT [I, A].
AML-like ChT is recommended for fit patients (generally
<70 years of age) with favourable cytogenetics accord- ing to IPSS and marrow blasts 10%, preferably as a bridge to allo-SCT [I, B].
Allo-SCT should be proposed to all higher-risk MDS pa- tients <70 years old without major comorbidities and with a donor [I, A].
Reducing the marrow blast count before allo-SCT with AML-like ChT or HMAs is generally considered when marrow blasts are 10%, especially for non- myeloablative allo-SCT [III, A].
ESAs (especially EPO alpha) are recommended for the first-line treatment of anaemia in lower-risk MDS in pa- tients without del(5q) [I, A].
For transfusion-dependent anaemia of lower-risk MDS with del(5q), LEN is the most effective drug [I, A].
After ESA failure, ATG ( cyclosporine) has efficacy in specific younger patient cohorts of lower-risk MDS [II, B]. After ESA failure in RBC transfusion-dependent MDS-RS, luspatercept is recommended [I, A].
Other second-line treatments for anaemia after ESA fail- ure include LEN    ESA [II, B] and HMAs [II, B], but they are not approved in Europe for this indication.
TPO-RAs (romiplostim, eltrombopag) have some efficacy in cases of severe thrombocytopaenia but they are not approved in MDS and should only be used in patients with marrow blasts <5% [II, C].
In patients with transfusion iron overload, iron chelation
is strongly recommended in candidates for allo-SCT [III, B].
In non-transplant candidates with lower-risk MDS, iron chelation is strongly recommended in patients with ma- jor iron overload (e.g. significantly reduced cardiac T2*) [III, B], but its use is more controversial in patients without major iron overload [I, V].


PERSONALISED MEDICINE
Most prognostic factors in MDS have been defined irre- spective of treatment and it is often unclear if they are predictive of efficacy of a given treatment.
The IPSS and IPSS-R offer a valuable means of patient stratification and have therefore served as a basis for Figures 2 and 3 to summarise treatment recommendations. For example, anaemia of lower-risk MDS often responds to
 
ESAs, except in case of del(5q) where LEN is very effective. On the other hand, in higher-risk patients, while azacitidine has been shown to improve survival, there are currently limited alternative options (except allo-SCT for a minority of patients).
Consideration of the patient’s age, PS, comorbidities, frailty and desire (after adequate information has been provided by the medical team) is also crucial before making any treatment decision.

FOLLOW-UP
Except for specific treatments, follow-up of MDS is largely based on regular blood counts to detect worsening cyto- paenias [anaemia or severe thrombocytopaenia requiring transfusions, or severe neutropaenia mandating preventive measures against infection (e.g. during invasive proced- ures)] and rapid onset of broad-spectrum antibiotics in case of symptoms of infection.
Bone marrow examination, with or without karyotype, is generally triggered by worsening of cytopaenias or the appearance of circulating blasts rather than being system- atically carried out at regular intervals.
